            "text": "A dream about a black dog indicates that you are a loved and respected person. Other interpretations, depending on the dreamer's status (single woman, married woman, pregnant woman, divorced woman, or man), include: being attacked by black dogs, dreaming of a black dog chasing you, seeing dogs running after you, or running away from a small black dog, as interpreted by Ibn Sirin, and other interpretations that will be discussed in this article: The Interpretation of a Black Dog in a Dream If you saw a black dog in your dream and it was obedient, calm, and didn't hurt you, it means you are an important person and highly valued in your family. But if you saw a wild black dog or it tried to attack you, assault you, or harm you, it means you are trying to achieve a goal you want to accomplish, but unfortunately, it will not be achieved no matter how hard you try.  If a black dog bit you in a dream, it means you or someone close to you, like your family, lover, or child, will face problems, difficulties, and hardships in your life and finances.  If you dreamt that a black dog attacked you and tore your clothes, it means a problem will occur regarding your honor and dignity, something that may involve your lover, fiancé, spouse, son, or daughter, putting you in an embarrassing situation in front of people and society.  A married man who sees a black dog biting his arm, leg, or head in a dream means he is neglecting his family and relatives and is not attentive to them.  A pregnant woman dreaming of a black dog attacking her means her delivery will be difficult and strenuous.  A pregnant woman who sees a black dog biting her means she will become ill after delivery.  A black dog in a single woman's dream indicates the theft of her happiness and the duration of her sadness will be equal to the dog's ferocity.  If the black dog in your dream is aggressive or barks aggressively, it reflects an internal conflict you will face.  A ferocious black dog in a dream indicates that someone is stabbing you in the back and betraying you from among the people around you, within your family or friends.  A sick black dog in a dream symbolizes an old friendship you have neglected or feel that one of your friends has neglected. If you dream of feeding a black dog, it means you will revisit and care for an old skill or talent.  If you see a black dog with puppies in a dream, it reflects your ability to care for others and that others depend on you. If you see a dog biting in a dream or a black dog biting you, it reflects your failure to balance different aspects of your life, and it might mean that you are hesitant to move forward on some level or that you don't want to continue pursuing your previous goals. If you dream that the black dog bit another person, it reflects your feeling that you have wronged or betrayed someone in your life. Buying a dog in a dream reflects your tendency to buy your friends or flatter them to gain some privileges and praise. It can also mean that you need a partner or a friend in reality. If you dream of hurting a dog or hitting it, it means you doubt a friend's intentions or feel that a dear friend is letting you down because they don't support you. Ibn Sirin's Interpretation of a Black Dog in a Dream  The dream interpreter Muhammad Ibn Sirin says that seeing a black dog in a dream means you need to take care of your physical and mental health.  If you see a group of black dogs in a place or approaching you, this meaning warns you about your lifestyle and that some things you do or eat will continually threaten your health. This might be because you don't follow a healthy diet or exercise, and the dream also tells you to stop doing things that can harm your mental health and you should stop worrying about some things but instead be positive while working on it.  This dream also shows that you are worried about your family members, and the vision means that you care deeply for your loved ones, to the point that you are always worried about what might happen to them. Remember that it is always good to care for your family members, but excessive worry about them can make you do the wrong things.  A dream of a black dog can mean many problems in real life. Here, you will dream of an angry black dog coming towards you or a black dog swimming. This dream might scare you, but be careful because it gives you solutions.  Having an angry black dog in your dream means a big or scary problem in real life, so make sure you are cautious in every decision and step you take.  Dreaming of a black dog means someone will argue with you in real life, or if no one is arguing with you already, expect it to happen soon.  When seeing a black dog biting you or chasing you, the meaning of this dream can be related to a fight with your boss at your workplace, or an argument with your lover or even your neighbor at home. Make peace with everyone, and everything will be alright.  The meaning of a black dog in a dream can be that someone will betray you in real life, so be careful with your friends and relatives, because betrayal will not come from afar but from people close to you.  The betrayal can come from a lover, so be cautious about what your love partner does to you, because this person can break your heart anytime.  Dreaming of a black dog means you find it difficult to control your desires, and it is possible that you love someone or something that is not suitable for you.  If you dream of a giant black dog, it means you want to achieve most of your goals in life and you want to achieve it by any means possible.  Dreaming of a black dog means you have talents that need to be developed or that you have a skill inside you that needs to be cultivated, and sometimes you might not be aware of this skill that you have in your life.  If you see a black dog with white spots, this dream can sometimes mean the need to work on yourself by showing your strengths and weaknesses.  The death of the dog in the dream shows that you are losing your good feelings because you did something wrong or because you are constantly upset when people around you don't care or pay attention to you.  If you see a black dog die in a dream, it means you are guilty of some of your actions.  If you are not sorry for the death of the black dog, it indicates that you are guilty, but you never want to apologize for your actions."
