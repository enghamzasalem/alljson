            "text": "Seeing a baby breastfeeding in a dream is one of those visions that bring joy to hearts and make them smile. It is a blessed and reassuring vision for most people, as a baby symbolizes purity, a new beginning, kindness, and blessings.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream according to Ibn Sirin**\n\nHowever, interpretations vary and are numerous based on the dreamer's social status, the circumstances they are going through, and the events of the vision they saw. In this article, we will list the different interpretations of seeing a baby in a dream.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream**\n\nThe interpretation of a baby in a dream varies according to the events of the dream. If the baby is beautiful and calm, as is usual for babies, then this indicates kindness, blessings, the arrival of happiness, joy, and pleasure.  Seeing a baby in a dream means that good will come in the near future. \n\nThe interpretation of seeing a baby crying in a dream is different from seeing a baby that is quiet. This indicates worries and problems on a professional level. However, if the baby in the vision was born prematurely (born before nine months), this indicates a new project or that the dreamer is planning to start a project. A dead baby indicates loss, sadness, and severe pain, but if a person sees that he is beating a baby in a dream, this means that he has wronged someone and must stop this injustice.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream according to Ibn Sirin**\n\nIbn Sirin stated that seeing a baby breastfeeding in a dream means comfort, ease, and a way out of difficulties and crises, whether they are financial crises such as poverty, debts, or the loss of a project, or psychological crises such as anxiety, worry, sadness, and suffering. On the other hand, Ibn Sirin pointed out that seeing a baby in a dream indicates anxiety and sadness. If the dreamer sees that he has a son, this is evidence of livelihood and good solutions. If he sees himself as a returning infant, this indicates foolishness and that the dreamer is characterized by a weak personality and improper thinking about many issues in his life.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream according to Imam al-Sadiq**\n\nImam al-Sadiq interpreted the vision of a baby in a dream as comfort, good tidings, and salvation. If the dreamer is an unmarried girl, this means that she will get married or be proposed to in the near future. If this baby is beautiful, this is evidence that she will marry someone she loves or a boy of her dreams.\n\nHowever, if a married woman sees this vision, it indicates that the desires and aspirations that she has long dreamed of and demanded will be realized soon. For a man who sees this vision, it is a clear sign that he is starting a new life, such as marriage or starting a new project. If the dreamer is suffering from stress or sadness, this is salvation for him from their worries and an escape from those worries.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream for a single woman**\n\nIf an unmarried woman sees a baby in a dream, this indicates the approaching of a new matter related to marriage, work, or studies. If this baby is beautiful and lovely, this indicates her marriage to a young man who loves and cherishes her, and that she will live a happy married life with him.\n\nOn the contrary, if the unmarried girl does not remember the baby's shape, this may indicate anxiety, sadness, and misery that befall her.\n\n**Interpretation of a crying baby in a dream for a single woman**\n\nSeeing a crying baby in the dream of an unmarried woman is generally a bad or unfavorable vision because of the implications and signs that this vision carries. If an unmarried girl is seen trying to comfort the baby, make him laugh, or play with him, this indicates her ability to deal with these problems and her ability to overcome the obstacles she faces in general.\n\nThe baby's excessive crying may also indicate that her marriage has been delayed to some extent, but if he cries then laughs, this indicates the fulfillment of our desires and aspirations and the abundance of her livelihood.\n\n**Interpretation of seeing a baby in a dream for a married woman**\n\nSeeing a baby breastfeeding in a dream for a married woman generally indicates good and livelihood that will come to her, as well as the ability to live that she and her husband will face. The vision may also indicate that she is very worried about her husband and family, but if this baby is a male, it indicates an upcoming inheritance that she will receive soon. If the baby is female, it indicates an ability to live or the possibility of the marriage of one of her relatives or children.\n\nThe crying of a breastfeeding baby in the dream of a married woman indicates that the enemies around her are plotting against her and harbor hatred and envy in their hearts towards her. It may also indicate that she is facing a financial or psychological crisis and many problems with her husband.\n\n**Interpretation of adopting a baby in a dream for a married woman**\n\nSome commentators say that seeing this dream for a married woman is not a good interpretation. It may indicate her sadness and anxiety about finding it. It is also likely to indicate a deterioration in her health and illness, but if she sees that she is adopting a baby and refuses to go with her, this indicates that her circumstances will deteriorate and she will face problems that may last for a long time. It can also indicate her intense pursuit of something that troubles her.\n\n**Interpretation of seeing a baby vomit in a dream for a married woman**\n\nThis vision is one of the disturbing visions for everyone, as it carries bad implications and tidings, whether for the dreamer or for the baby if it is known in reality. The vision generally indicates difficulties, hardships, and pressures in life. It also indicates the instability of her social relationships and the lack of a strong bond between her and her acquaintances. If the breastfeeding baby vomits on the married woman's clothes in a dream, this indicates sins or transgressions that she has committed and must repent from. As for if this baby is her son, this indicates that she is prone to envy.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream for a pregnant woman**\n\nSeeing a baby in a dream for a pregnant woman is often an indication of the gender of the child she will give birth to. If she sees a girl, she will give birth to a boy. \n\nIn general, this vision indicates an easy delivery and her preoccupation with her due date.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream for a divorced woman**\n\nSeeing a baby breastfeeding in a dream for a divorced woman indicates the cessation of anxiety, sadness, and misery, and the transformation of her life for the better. The vision also indicates the possibility of marrying a righteous and truthful man and living a happy married life with him. However, if she sees that she is giving birth from her ex-husband, this is a sign that she will return to him and live a good life with him.\n\n**Interpretation of a baby in a dream for a man**\n\nSeeing a man breastfeeding in a dream is a good vision because it means livelihood, kindness, and success in all aspects of life. \n"
