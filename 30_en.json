Seeing elderly female friends in a dream, this vision indicates beautiful days, and this vision also indicates getting rid of problems and diseases and living in comfort. Seeing old friends shows joy, happiness and success, and this vision also reflects the longing of its owner and the desire to regain his memories with these friends.

This dream represents your desire to have a carefree, easy, and hassle-free life. The dream with an old friend indicates a state of pure comfort that you want in your waking life, but this does not happen in reality. This dream also talks about your desire to become irresponsible and enjoy more fun in your waking life. You want to live a comfortable life and these unfulfilled desires appear in dreams. Seeing an old friend also indicates good luck and prosperity in the near future. Interpretation of an old friend's wedding in a dream Seeing marriage to an old friend in a dream If the seer is single, this means that the seer will achieve his goals and that he will meet an understanding, honest, loving and kind-hearted girl, and that he will live a beautiful period where his success in the plans he has set for his life will appear, and it also indicates that the seer will neglect his family duties and responsibilities, which will lead him to separate from someone close to him.

Interpretation of hitting an old friend in a dream Seeing yourself hitting an old friend in a dream means that the dreamer will face unexpected problems and difficulties, and this vision, according to some interpreters, indicates sins and gossip. Interpretation of killing an old friend in a dream Seeing an old friend being killed in a dream shows remorse and that the dreamer will realize the mistake of what he did and will regret it very much, but this repentance will not benefit the dreamer because he broke another person's heart and it will be a great effort to rectify the situation.
