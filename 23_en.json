Since this vision is common and widespread among people, we found that we need to know all the details and what they mean through the opinions of the great commentators. You will find all this and more in this article.  Follow us.\n\nInterpretation of the gecko dream by Ibn Shaheen Al-Zahiri: The vision of the gecko is nothing but a sign of the presence of an enemy near the gossipers, but he has no way to do so.  Ibn Shaheen summarized that seeing a gecko is not good at all, no matter how different the events of the vision are. \n\nLeprosy in a dream is evidence of the immorality of the person who walks among people with gossip and turmoil, spreading evil and forbidding good.  The Prophet, peace be upon him, ordered us to kill the leper in the sanctuary and the holy place; because it is one of the reptiles that harm people.  Whoever sees many geckos in a dream, this indicates the spread of sedition, conflicts, and gossip in all segments of society.  Walking on the wall may indicate the presence of a person between the dreamer and one of his parents.\n\nWhile if the leper walks over the dreamer's body, this is a sign that symbolizes the presence of a corrupt person from whom the dreamer is safe.  The dreamer's ability to get rid of all the calamities that befell him before.  Seeing a leper entering the house indicates the corruption of family relationships due to the spread of rumors and disturbances among them, while seeing him in fields and gardens is a warning vision.  Whoever sees the gecko in his drink and food, this vision indicates that he is sitting with bad companions who get close to him and talk to him.  Among the unfavorable visions that must be guarded against is seeing the gecko in bed, as it indicates the unsuitability of the wife or the presence of jinn who want to separate the couple.  Seeing the leper bigger than its natural size indicates the presence of a hypocrite who bewitches people with his words, but in reality he is a deceitful person with no good behind him.\n\nInterpretation of the gecko dream by Ibn Sirin: Ibn Sirin explained that seeing a gecko in a dream refers to the lost class of people who seek corruption and command evil and turn them away from good.  Seeing a gecko also symbolizes the act of sin and openness without shame or fear, while eating it in a dream leads to evil and gossip.  Whoever sees himself eating the flesh of the gecko, this is evidence that he is one of the gossipers.\n\nThe interpretation of the chameleon vision is completely different from the gecko, as it refers to the category of kings and ministers and their immediate environment, as well as men of power and determination.\n\nInterpretation of the gecko dream for a single woman: There are many interpretations that symbolize that seeing the gecko in a dream for a girl indicates the presence of an enemy in her life and a cunning gossip.  Anyone who sees himself in a dream chasing a gecko and chasing him to kill him, this is the girl who has good deeds and seeks to do good and forbid evil.  If she succeeds in killing him, this indicates getting rid of all the temptations and stray desires.  As for seeing the leper walking on her body, this indicates her contact with the people of sedition and tolerance with them, so as not to separate from them.  Seeing large numbers of geckos in dreams symbolizes invasion and spreading gossip among those around her.  If the girl sees a gecko in her dream and feels afraid and terrified of it, this indicates the weakness of her faith and the fear of people from temptation.\n\nAmong the praiseworthy visions in the dream of a single woman is seeing herself defeating the gecko and catching it.  This is good news for her, indicating her victory over her enemies and her overcoming them.\n\nA gecko chasing me - dream interpretation for a single woman: Seeing a gecko chasing a single woman in her dream means that she is surrounded by many unsuitable women and wants to get rid of them, but she cannot.\n\nOne of the undesirable dreams is to dream of a gecko in a dream for a girl while she is chasing it, due to its many terrifying implications, as it indicates acts of deception and sorcery, as well as the presence of evil people in the dreamer's life.  It can also indicate illness and enemies, as well as the deception of those close to her.\n\nInterpretation of a gecko falling in the dream of a single woman: It is a hated vision in the dream of a single woman because it leads to evil and harm from those close to her.  The gecko falling on a girl who has not yet married is a sign to be wary of her emotional dealings in the coming days.  The general interpretation of this vision symbolizes envy, hatred, magic, gossip, and hatred through which the girl is in her country.\n\nInterpretation of the gecko dream for a married woman: Among the dreams that haunt women is seeing the gecko in her sleep, as some have interpreted this vision as the presence of many family problems and crises in her life.  Therefore, she must be careful.  If the married woman sees that she is killing the leper and taking it out of her, this is one of the visions that bode well, because it symbolizes the solution to all family and financial problems, getting a lot of money and livelihood, then paying off all her debts.  The presence of the leper in the woman's kitchen in a dream symbolizes that the source of food is from haram money, and therefore its impurity.\n\nFear of the gecko in a dream for a married woman: The leper in the woman's dream, and her fear of it, warns of the harm of people in her life, and she needs to be cautious of them.  Whoever sees a gecko in bed and is afraid of it, this symbolizes that her partner is betraying her and his desire to keep her away from him in the coming days.  Seeing a dark-colored gecko walking around the house and frightening me, this dream leads to the escalation of many problems and crises between her and her husband, which may lead to separation.  Fear of the leper and effort to get him out of the house is a pleasant vision, as it symbolizes the strength of her faith and her closeness to God and her adherence to religious teachings.  Seeing a large gecko and being afraid of it in a dream is an indication that the woman will suffer from serious injustice in her life from someone who has authority over her.  Fear generally symbolizes sins and transgressions and can enable the devil to see her.\n\nThe gecko running away in a dream for a married woman: There are many implications for escaping the gecko, as it symbolizes the wife's escape from troubles and taking on family responsibilities.  While the gecko ran away and the wife was able to kill it, this is a sign of getting rid of financial crises and everything that bothers her life in the coming days.  This vision may symbolize the presence of people close to her who are plotting against her and want to besiege her.  Seeing the gecko on the head of one of the children leads to the son suffering from health problems and may indicate that one of his sons is in danger.
