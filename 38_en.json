            "text": "Dreaming of a ring indicates a bond, an increase in kindness and money, and other meanings we will mention for single, married, pregnant, divorced, and for the man, for example. Wearing a ring or a wedding ring, losing a golden or silver ring, or dreaming that your ring is broken, or finding a broken ring, Ibn Sirin and others in continuation of the topic: The interpretation of the ring in a dream The vision of the ring in a dream indicates a successful relationship with a lover, an honest and just person, and a loyal person. If a girl sees herself wearing a ring in a dream and she is not married, or she is carrying a ring or found it, for example, in any place, this means that she will get a groom, that is, she will get married, God willing. If a person dreams that he is wearing a silver ring, and he is wearing it wherever he wants, and this is allowed to him, then power will hit him. If a married woman dreams that she has a ring on her hand, or she found a ring, this means that God will bless her with a boy, which means that she is about to give birth to a son. If she dreams that the golden ring is broken, this means that evil has passed with you, God willing. Whoever sees that he lost the ring in a dream, this is a loss of glory, influence and prestige, because the ring is power and authority, and its loss is their loss. Seeing the engagement ring is good news for an upcoming engagement and marriage. The ring that a person takes in a dream can be a house where he lives, but if the ring is made of gold, it is not good, and if it is made of iron or copper, it is considered a bad omen for the dreamer. The ring in a dream indicates the father, wife or money, and for the man, if the ring is made of gold, it is considered humiliation for him. Wearing a ring on your hand in a dream generally means that you possess something, whether it is material or personal. If you receive a ring as a gift in your dream, it symbolizes emotional perfection, the continuity that complements your emotional state, your emotional commitment or your honor. If you see a ring on your finger, it symbolizes your commitment to a relationship or entering into a new attempt to share. If you see that you are wearing a ring on your hand, this symbolizes that you are a loyal person who adheres to his principles, responsibilities and beliefs. If you see in a dream that your ring is broken, this calls into question your faith. On the other hand, the broken ring in a dream can also mean the end of a relationship or the loss of commitment. If you dream of losing a ring or someone stealing it from you, it symbolizes your insecurity. It can also symbolize that you are losing interest in a relationship or a particular topic.  The interpretation of the ring in a dream by Al-Nabulsi Imam Al-Nabulsi says, if you see in your dream that you found a ring, this vision predicts that you will get a lot of money soon, God willing, but if you see that you are wearing a ring made of silver, this indicates that you will find an excellent job soon. If you see in your dream that you are wearing an iron ring, this indicates a lot of livelihood, but after a lot of fatigue and hardship. If you see someone giving you a ring, this indicates love and cooperation. If a young man sees a ring in his dream, this means marriage soon. Losing a ring is one of the unfavorable visions, and it shows the many worries and problems in the dreamer's life, while losing the ring for the married person indicates marital problems that may lead to divorce. The interpretation of the ring in a dream by Ibn Sirin Seeing a silver ring on the right hand indicates her marriage, while seeing a ring studded with precious stones indicates the existence of a relationship with a man of influence, prestige and knowledge. Wearing a ring on the right hand in a dream for an unmarried woman is a sign of her close bond, but seeing a golden ring in a dream indicates that she does not have a share with her life partner. Seeing an unmarried girl wearing a ring on her right hand and breaking it in a dream is a sign of the cancellation of her engagement and separation from her due to a lack of understanding between them. Seeing an unmarried girl selling the ring she is wearing in a dream is a sign of her separation from her lover or fiancé. Seeing a married woman wearing a ring in a dream and her husband helping her wear it means pregnancy in the near future. Wearing a ring on the right hand in the dream of a married woman indicates an abundance of wealth and the arrival of abundant kindness. Losing the ring or stealing it or its disappearance from the married woman on her right hand indicates that she left her husband or divorced him. Seeing a married woman wearing a ring in a dream may indicate her recovery from illness if she is sick. Losing the ring worn by a man on his right hand is evidence of losing someone he loves, whether it is his father, mother, sisters, sons or wife. Stealing someone's ring in a man's dream is evidence that he will get money or land, or that he will marry his wife after her divorce. Losing the ring worn on the right hand of a man indicates a great financial loss in reality. Wearing a ring in a dream for a man who was a merchant is evidence of achieving a lot of profits in reality. Seeing a man selling the ring he is wearing on his right hand indicates the loss of his current job, a financial loss during a recent deal. For a pregnant woman, wearing a golden ring on her right hand means she will give birth to a baby girl. Wearing a silver ring on the right hand of a pregnant woman is evidence that she will give birth to a baby boy. And seeing a pregnant woman wearing a ring studded with diamonds, rubies, and precious stones in a dream is evidence of the birth of a beautiful boy who will have a wonderful and generous future, God willing. Wearing a ring on the right hand in a young man's dream indicates outstanding success if he is a student who is still studying. Seeing a young man hitting him with a ring in a dream means that he will benefit greatly from it or benefit, or that this man will give him money. Selling the ring worn by the young man on his right hand indicates that he will separate from his lover or fiancée and leave her soon. Washing the ring worn by the young man on his right hand in a dream indicates that the dreamer is walking the path of piety and faith. Wearing an old ring in a dream for a divorcee may indicate her return to her ex-husband, and if the ring is made of gold, then it indicates her marriage to a respectable and noble man. As for wearing the ring on the left hand in a dream, according to the interpretation of Ibn Sirin, it is a blessed vision if the dreamer seems happy. This may indicate that the unmarried girl is marrying a man who has the qualities she desires and hopes for in her life partner. Wearing a ring on her left hand for an unmarried girl, but she felt fear and awe, is evidence that she will marry a man who has a high position or works in an important position in the state, not an ordinary man like the rest of the public. Wearing an iron ring on her left hand in a dream for an unmarried girl means that she will marry a rich man, God willing.

The west realizes the fear of the seer, and the presence of many obsessions and negative thoughts that negatively affect his life.\nSunrise in a dream for single women\nIf an unmarried girl sees the sun rising from its rising, this is good news for her about her proximity to a young man who is of great importance in society and has power and influence over people in general, and her happiness with H. The sunrise is an indication of comfort and the death of the hardships and difficulties that controlled her life and made her drown in the sea of darkness for many years, and she must declare that God Almighty will illuminate her path and take care of her, where she does not wait.\nIf the brightness of the sun in the girl's dream causes her to suffer from some pains and burns, this is a bad sign that she feels suffering in reality, and this may be due to her failure to achieve her goal after many efforts and sacrifices. Or is it a sign of separation from her lover and the pain of his absence from her life, and God knows best.\nSunrise in a dream for a married woman\nThe appearance of the bright and radiant sun in the married woman's house symbolizes many good signs that prove her happy life and joy with her husband because of his appreciation for her and respect for her, which makes her feel satisfaction and gratitude for him. If she sees her husband leaving the house at sunrise, she fears most people revealing a secret in front of her, and they are doing their best to hide it from her, but God Almighty will reveal his matter very soon.\nIf the wife feels sad at the present time because of her husband's journey and her need for him, then the sunrise in her house indicates the return of the husband after years of absence, and if one of her family members is suffering from illness or a psychological crisis, he will be healed by the command of God Almighty and things will return to their normal state and stability.\nSunrise in a dream for a pregnant woman\nSeeing the sun by a pregnant woman means many different symbols and indicators for her, as the sunrise from the east indicates that the pregnancy is going well and that she will enjoy a period of calm and stability even if she is in the last months of pregnancy, so she must prepare for childbirth because the facilitator is close to that day It will be free of obstacles and complications by the command of God.\nIf she sees the sunset, she must be careful, because the dream is a bad warning about bad circumstances, and her exposure to many health problems that may lead to her losing the fetus, God forbid. The dreamer must trust God and pray a lot, and she will find good things and blessings and her newborn will be of great importance in the future, and God knows best.\nSunrise in a dream for a divorced woman\nSunrise in the dream of a divorced woman is a message of optimism and an invitation for her to be optimistic, and to get rid of all the sorrows that she is going through at the present time as a result of the many disagreements and arguments in her life. With her ex-husband, in addition to the fact that she was carrying the burdens of her children alone, she saw it in the past from traumatic events.\nIf the vision touches the rays of the sun and feels the scorching heat, this alerts her to the need to be cautious and wary of some people around her, because it is very likely that she will be exposed to sins and gossip, and there are those who slander her reputation with lies and rumors, and it is likely that she will lose her position in her work, so she will fall into conspiracies against her.\nSunrise in a dream for a man\nIf the dreamer is a young unmarried man, then his vision of the sunrise in the house is an indication of his marriage to a beautiful girl who is well-educated, and she will be the cause of his happiness and will bring him comfort and peace. The appearance of many disagreements and differences between them, and this can lead to separation in the end.\nAs for the married man, his vision of the sunrise interprets the good that will come into his life, regardless of his successful marital relationship that is permeated by the exchange of love and respect between the two sides, and the sunrise in the dream. The seer predicts an improvement in his material conditions and earning a lot of money in permissible and legitimate ways, and God knows best.\nSunset in a dream\nThere are some cases in a dream about the sunset that do not symbolize good, so if the dreamer sees the sun looking red at sunset, this is a bad sign of his corruption and many sins that he has committed, so he should retreat and repent before that. It's too late, but some other interpretations have shown that the sunset is a good sign, regarding the removal of worries and sorrow from a person's life and his readiness to draw closer to God Almighty...\n"

Whoever sees a house from afar in a dream indicates that he lives in stability with his wife or that he lives in peace with his wife, as they agree and love each other. Whoever sees a house made of gold in a dream, this is a warning of evil for the dreamer, and this evil will befall his house and expose it to destruction. Whoever sees a big house in a dream in front of him and is very close to him in his sleep, this indicates that he intends to buy or build a new house, and the process of building or buying is on the ground and he finds a safe haven and hopes for him.
