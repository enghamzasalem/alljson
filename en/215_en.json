One of the dreamers asked him about the interpretation of his vision, which states the following (I saw someone calling me in a dream), and the interpreter answered him with many interpretations that you will know through the specialized Egyptian website. We will show you everything that Ibn Sirin, Al-Nabulsi and other scholars said, just follow the following paragraphs. Calling in a dream Calling in a dream is considered one of the precise visions whose interpretations vary depending on its symbols, which means that the dreamer may see in his dream someone calling him and addressing him with a specific message. Each of them separately through the following points: Whether or not: If the dreamer sees in a dream that he is in a place that he does not know and that frightens him, and he hears someone calling him forcefully, then this vision carries two symbols: First: A strange, frightening place. Second: The person who called. If the two symbols meet together in the vision This will lead to the death of the dreamer, provided that he is not aware of the person who called him. Second: If the dreamer is in an unfamiliar house and hears someone calling him and responds to him and wants to search for him to find out who it is that is calling him. The meaning of this scene is bad and suggests that the viewer is a weak person and perhaps... The meaning of the word (weak) is weak character and inability to face life's challenges, and this bad trait contains many things. Among his bad qualities are the following: The great ability of others to easily influence the dreamer, and this deprives him of his opinion in many situations. He may fail in his emotional, professional and personal life. Others may attack him and take away his rights, then he loses the ability and ability that qualifies him to regain that right. The rapist is from him. Third: The way the call is made in the dream has a strong influence on the interpretation of the dream. For example, if the dreamer heard someone calling him and that person laughed so loudly that his laughter reached laughter and was louder than usual. In this scene, Ibn Sirin said that it will be interpreted the opposite, that is, this laughter heard in the dream will turn into Crying and lamentation in waking life, and the dreamer will soon experience dreary days, all of them sorrows. He may soon cry when he hears that a loved one has died. He may be sad because he has lost something big in his life, such as losing all his money, or a major loss that deteriorates his financial situation Terrifyingly. Perhaps the reason for the crying is the loss of a lover and separation from him, and perhaps the interpretation of this scene is that he will cry after hearing the news of his failure or dismissal from work. However, there is an important thing that must be made clear, which is: Although it is difficult to interpret this dream, all difficult situations In life it is fleeting, no matter how long you are with the person. The interpretation of seeing it as not good is to pray to God to remove any adversity from him, as he may go through it while facing crises in his life, but God’s providence will be a reason to relieve his pain and pressure. Interpretation of seeing the call in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin had his unique mark in interpreting this dream and provided It has four important interpretations: Whether or not: Ibn Sirin said that this vision in general is one of the symbols that quickly brings sadness and sorrow to the pioneer.
