The money and securities that we usually deal with in banks, as well as checks, bills of exchange and various types of documents are not necessarily interpreted as money, but in fact they interpret the psychological energy of a person, especially emotions, feelings and emotions. Depositing a large amount of money into a bank or bank account is actually a transfer of positive energy towards a humanitarian or social work that brings the viewer double benefit. As for withdrawing amounts from the bank, it indicates a state of weakness and humiliation that awaits the viewer after exhausting all his material and moral capabilities. Everything we see in the bank or in the bank has a precious meaning and value. Safes, jewels and bonds are of no value in themselves because the dreamer may see someone in the bank and this person is actually important to fortune-tellers in waking life, whether with or without the fortune-teller's awareness, and in a dream.

Robbing a bank or bank in a dream As for the one who sees in his dream that he is stealing money from the bank or bank in the process of taking out the safes and looting everything that is cash, gold, money, jewelry or even papers, contracts and bonds, then in reality he is doing something that involves risks that may affect his physical or psychological balance. Because banks are usually under heavy guard and surveillance and the alarm system can go off at any time, this will of course reveal the thief and his intentions, and of course thwart all his ill-conceived plans. As for the iron and armored safes of the bank, they are an expression of the extent of the viewer's need for protection at this time, because he is about to take on a risky subject that requires insurance and fortification, either materially, that is, money, or through affection, especially fatherhood or motherhood. Entering the bank and depositing money or withdrawing from the bank in a dream If you see in your dream that you are entering a bank with the intention of depositing money, this is a good interpretation, because the bank in this context is a symbol of a safe haven, and the meaning of the dream of the bank is that you are staying away from dangers.
