This vision has many girls in a dream, which leads to their confusion about the meaning of their dream, whether it carries good messages or a warning message about the need to be careful about something or a decision that a single woman is thinking about making. Cats One of the pets that some people prefer to raise at home, the cat is the closest friend for many people, but cats are known for their betrayal and denial of beauty. As for seeing them in a dream, we will talk about it in detail in the following lines through the encyclopedia, so follow us. Interpretation of seeing a white cat in a dream for a single woman. The great scholar Muhammad Ibn Sirin says about the interpretation of seeing a white cat in one dream: A white cat in one dream symbolizes an unfaithful and insincere friend. A white cat in a dream represents a handsome man with a soft face who is trying to get close to a single woman, but he is cunning, malicious, and ill-tempered and wants to harm her. An attack by a white cat in an unmarried woman’s dream indicates problems that an unmarried woman is trying to get rid of and overcome in vain. A single dream symbolizes unhappiness and gossip, as well as hatred and jealousy from some friends and those around her. Small white cats playing with unmarried women in a dream means happiness and good news. Interpretation of feeding cats in a dream for a single woman, according to what Ibn Sirin narrated in the dream interpretation books about a vision Cats feeding in a dream, we provide the following interpretations: An unmarried woman feeding a calm white cat in a dream indicates the stability and family happiness that the dreamer experiences. Seeing a single woman feeding a white cat or watering it in a dream symbolizes her psychological readiness to rely on herself and realize herself in the areas of work. Seeing a hungry white cat that refuses to be fed indicates the financial hardships that an unmarried woman and her family will face. Seeing him eating cat meat is an unpleasant vision that indicates illness and severe anxiety. Interpretation of seeing cats being expelled from the house in a dream. Seeing cats alone being expelled from the house in a dream has different meanings. We present them below: Banishing quarrels from the house in a dream indicates getting rid of disputes and returning peace and stability to the people of the house. The black cat was chased away in one dream and had an emotional relationship such as an engagement, and this vision shows the end of that engagement that would cause her Harm. The black cat symbolizes a cunning man, a deceitful thief. Expelling a hungry cat from the home of an unmarried woman in a dream indicates poverty, and the situation will change to sadness and distress, God forbid. Interpretation of a dream about giving birth to a cat in the house. Cats in a dream sometimes symbolize genes, as Jinns often imagine themselves in the form of cats. The birth of a cat in a dream indicates the evil that the jinn directs against the dreamer.
