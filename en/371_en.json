Interpretation of a dream about the dead in a dream by Ibn Sirin Interpretation of a dream about the dead in a dream Many said that seeing the dead is a real thing in many cases, and we all expect to see the dead person in a dream to make sure that he is in a better condition than he was in life, and from here it is necessary to know the details of the vision to reach it with the correct interpretation. For example, if he saw him coming to him in the most beautiful dress, and that was in the name of the person, then he rejoices in secrets, then he certainly reached a distinguished position with the Lord of the Worlds, and he came to him because he wanted to reassure all family members through the seer. As for if he finds a bad smell from him, it is a somewhat disturbing dream, as it shows that he was not a righteous man in his life, but he is looking for a supporter in the world and someone who gives him good deeds. And the Zakat due until God accepts him among those with Him. A dead person may come to you and you do not know him and you find yourself in your dream dealing with getting to know him without achieving anything, and here the dream means that you are in a state of turmoil and tension in your life. And you feel as if you are walking on a path that is not your path in the first place and you are thinking of retreating.
