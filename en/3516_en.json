Come at all for this purpose. Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of seeing a chair in a dream. If the chair is of iron, then it is power and success, and if it is of wood, then it is hypocrisy. And whoever sees: that he is sitting on a chair, he will be an agent or manager and will receive a rise, and if he is absent, he will return to His family, and the chair refers to those who have high chairs, wives, children, and luxurious residences. Whoever sees that he bought a chair and sits down, he will get married. He was told that his pregnant wife had given birth to a son for him, and it was said that he would die a martyr. Whoever sees that his chair is broken, it portends his death, or the death of his wife, or the loss of his money, and the chair is a source of joy and joy for whoever sits, or a sign of victory in the afterlife. There is no good in it for the sick, and seeing the Throne of Almighty God above the highest heavens is evidence of people of knowledge reaching high ranks and positions. A chair in a dream for a pregnant woman is salvation from her distress. A single person is married, and a married person has a child. This also shows a journey and the sick person has to carry him to his deathbed or on the back of a mounted animal. Or a house in which a person lives or follows him.

Interpretation of the most important visions and dreams in which a chair is seen. Buying a chair in a dream means an important position, property ownership, or marriage. A chair in a dream for a married woman is a blessing and kindness. A chair in a dream for a pregnant woman is salvation and blessing. If an unmarried girl sees that she is sitting on a chair in a dream, she will get married soon. ",
