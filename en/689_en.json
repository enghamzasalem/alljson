            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about a white dove in a dream The dove is one of the birds that most countries consider a symbol of peace and love. The dove was chosen as a symbol of peace in 1949 at the World Peace Conference in Paris, after a period in which the planet witnessed a bloody world war that claimed millions of lives. The dove has great importance in the Islamic religion, as it protected the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, in the Cave of Thor with his companion Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may God be pleased with him). It is the same bird that the Prophet Noah, peace be upon him, used to guide him while he was in his ship. Therefore, for all people, the dove represents something great. What does the dream world symbolize? Interpretation of a dream about a white dove in a dream In general, we find that the interpretation of seeing a white dove in a dream includes many different connotations and symbols, which are mostly commendable visions. These indications can be presented as follows: The first indication includes three points It symbolizes a message coming from afar, because many interpreters interpret the vision of the dove as a messenger of very important messages that must be read carefully and slowly and believe what it brings. It is interpreted as a precious gift for you from a member of your family. It indicates love, emotional stability, reaping financial gains and wishing you good luck. The second indication includes four points The white dove is a sign of piety, good morals, many good deeds and an indication of seeking the truth and expressing it without fear and spontaneity in actions that may lead to the seer being misunderstood, because he does not think more than once when he speaks because his intention is correct, but he may say the words incorrectly. A circumstance that makes others think about him, so he has to slow down when he speaks because his intention will be interpreted. It shows that the fortune teller has forgotten something very important and that the dove here acts as a tool for remembrance. If you see it walking behind you everywhere, this indicates that God takes care of you and leads you to the right path and that there is an angel appointed by God to protect you. And if it appears periodically, for example, every month or year, this is evidence that you have called upon God and your prayer has been accepted, and this call will soon be fulfilled. The third sign includes two points: If you see it flying in the sky and heading towards you, this is a message that your emotional partner has agreed to your request and it also symbolizes that you intend to open a new page in your life and forget the past with everything inside it. And if you see a flock of pigeons, you are on a date with a lot of good news that will change your lifestyle for the better and it is an indication of a period of peace in your life that can start by traveling to a place on the beach for entertainment and some time. The white dove has other interpretations that most commentators agree on, which are: If the dove is sitting on your shoulder and you see yourself stroking it with your hand, this indicates your great interest With your family and bearing responsibility from your childhood, which indicates great pressures and a refuge for you in everything big and small, and that it is time for others to carry you.
