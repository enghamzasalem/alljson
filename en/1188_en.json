            "html": " Interpretation of seeing lightning in a dreamDreams and dreams are a projection of thoughts, ideas, and fears that circulate in a person’s subconscious, but we must know that what we see in our dreams has meaning, interpretation, and interpretation, or is it possible that what we see in dreams are the messages that guide us? In this article, we will talk about the interpretation of a vision. Lightning in a dream and what it indicates. Interpretation of seeing lightning in a dreamIn this paragraph we present to you the interpretation of the great scholar Ibn Sirin for seeing lightning in a dream, based on what was stated in his book attributed to him, where Ibn Sirin explained to us that seeing lightning in a dream has many connotations: We will discover That is in the following lines. Seeing lightning in a dream may indicate anxiety and fear of the ruler, president, or person in power who threatens and threatens the dreamer. This is in addition to seeing lightning in a dream, which can indicate the scourge of arrows and tragic and terrifying news, as well as flogging with whips. It is also possible that seeing lightning in a dream is evidence of injustice, cruelty, intimidation and intimidation, as it indicates what is contrary to joy, pleasure and mercy. It is also said that seeing lightning in a dream indicates that you attract the ruler, lust and hope with him, and they came to the news and we learned that the King of the Clouds He has a whip assigned to lightning and that sound is like thunder. As mentioned in the Holy Qur’an in the words of God Almighty: “He is the one who showed you lightning out of fear and greed.” Different interpretations of seeing lightning in a dream Lightning is known for its speed, it occurs quickly and disappears quickly, and lightning is known for its scarcity and short duration. So, seeing lightning indicates that something urgent and quick will happen, but it does not last long. For example, if one sees lightning in his dream and he has crops to plant, but this plant has dried up and his land has become barren, then the lightning comes to foretell heavy rain and it will come. But if The lightning in his dream was traveling or intending to travel, so the lightning is a sign of the interruption of this journey, either due to heavy rain that prevents him from traveling, or by the order of the ruler or person in authority. Also, seeing lightning in a dream indicates that if the fortuneteller has a ruler or his father or guardian is angry with him or angry with him, then the appearance of lightning gives him good news that he will accept it and laugh in his face. It should be noted that Arab poets likened crying to rain, laughter and lightning, because they see Laughter reveals what is hidden and reveals what is hidden. Interpretation of seeing lightning accompanied by rain. If a person sees lightning in his dream accompanied by rain, then this has an unpleasant sign.
