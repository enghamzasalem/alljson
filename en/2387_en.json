            "html": " Seeing a martyr in a dream, a person wishes to die a martyr and reach the high status that God grants to martyrs, but have you ever seen a martyr or talked to him in a dream? What is the meaning of this dream? We will explain during the article the many interpretations associated with seeing a witness in a dream. Seeing a martyr in a dream by Ibn Sirin Seeing a witness in a dream Most interpreters expect that the dream indicates the dreamer's patriotism and his intense love for the homeland and preserving it, especially if he has a job related to protecting it. There is a big difference between the scholars of interpretation in the meaning of seeing a martyr, some of them expect it to be very good, and another group emphasizes the treachery and betrayal that befalls the dreamer with this vision. Experts say that the dreamer who finds himself in a dream as a witness expands his livelihood and raises his status, and the path to life becomes open to him. If a person speaks to a witness in his dream, the scholars of interpretation indicate that he will hear news that brings him happiness and alleviates and improves his material conditions and may be related to the idea of ​​​​a happy life and a long life. As for the living witness in a dream, it is one of the happy signs that indicate a person's intelligence in distinguishing himself either by his good work or his great effort, as well as his closeness to God and his readiness to provide good to people. Seeing the grave in which the martyr was buried confirms the dreamer’s happiness in caring for those around him, solving their crises, and providing assistance to them. Seeing the martyr in a dream, according to Imam al-Sadiq. Imam al-Sadiq expects that this vision will be one of the happy and promising visions for the dreamer, which works to increase goodness and relieve distress from his life. If one finds himself standing at the martyr’s grave and recites the Holy Quran or calls him, then we give him good news of the end of every difficult crisis he is going through. The dream also explains another matter, which is his generosity and good reputation. As for walking to the funeral of the martyr and seeing it, the dreamer enjoys more blessings and success, as it means the good condition and sincere worship of God Almighty. And whoever sees himself as a martyr in his dream, Imam al-Sadiq expresses that he will obtain a lot of money and succeed in his work with distinction and rise to the top. Seeing the martyr in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin explains that seeing witnesses in a dream is one of the things that show a person's love for knowledge and continuous knowledge and his readiness to benefit from his knowledge and use it to protect those around him. In the event that the dreamer is negligent in worshiping the Creator and is far from Him and witnesses this dream, he must repent to God and hasten to do good deeds that please Him. There is an interpretation in this vision by Ibn Sirin that confirms some deception in which the person sees the dream because there is a group of people in his life who pretend to love him but hide their hatred from him. The owner of the dream is certainly stuck in many family disputes or disturbances and feels psychologically exhausted due to the distance of some important figures from him, but there is good news related to the vision, which is the strength of the person.
