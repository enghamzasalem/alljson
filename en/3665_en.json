In it, the Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months in which the Qur’an was revealed as guidance for people. And a clear guideline and standard. The Night of Destiny: How do you know the blessings of a night with a thousand worlds? Ramadan is light in the minarets and mosques, light in the hearts and chests, in it is light and remembrance, in it is the Night of Destiny, in it is the glory of conquest, in it is the victory of the full moon, and in it. In conclusion, the joy of Eid and the joy of Eid al-Fitr. I ask God for you and me to show us the Night of Destiny and bless those who sit in it, and clear our chests, comfort us and relieve our worries. Every year, you are closer to God. It is the beautiful night, the night of peace and purity, a night in which the sincere heart cries, Longing for mercy, forgiveness, and liberation from hell. Is it a month similar to it that contains Laylat al-Qadr? .. How much of the authenticity of what is good has been reported from trustworthy people that they were asked about Witr prayer, so blessed is the one who asks. During them are among the ten days in which wealth descends with light and justice...from Hell without knowing it. It is the Night of Destiny that I depart from you with your deeds, and you come tomorrow with your deeds. Well, may my poetry be what I have deposited into it, and by what actions have I supported it? Do you see her leaving, admitting your actions, or condemning your waste? Oh God, bring me closer to the Night of Decree, O God, Creator of the heavens and the earth, green and roses, strengthen me, save me from the torment of the Fire, and forgive me my sins, O Forgiver. O Creator of the crescent and the full moon, honor the Night of Destiny. A few words about the Night of Destiny. The Night of Destiny is considered to have signs such as the sun appearing during the day without rays and turning red, and the night is a moderate atmosphere, neither hot nor cold. And the hope of being rewarded is that his previous sins will be forgiven.” On the authority of Al-Bukhari: I love you for the sake of God... so do not deprive us of your earnest supplication in these blessed nights. I will be very grateful... if I put a message between your lips tonight... your warmest, most sincere and best prayers. The days and nights creep upon us in flashes... their days are blessings. Its nights are rak'ahs... and its hours are prayers... and the Qur'an and prayer. On this blessed night, I wish the whole world were pure in your hands... but it is worth nothing... so I prayed to God that the sky would be stable for your feet. Praise be to God sometimes... We created seasons of goodness... and breaths of faith... and every night is destiny and you find work... and greater hope... and pain in general... and happier now... and God’s mercy... and heaven is closer. Oh God, what goodness, prosperity and abundance you have distributed in this night, make us A share in it... and the evil and affliction that you afflicted him with, take it away from me. And all Muslims. O Lord, if it is Laylat al-Qadr, I ask you to... "
