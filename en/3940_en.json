If you see the interpretation of a dream about cutting hair, this indicates an internal desire to emerge with a new look in front of others and change some bad habits that prevented the dreamer from living normally. Seeing the same dreamer cutting his hair more than once in a dream means that the dreamer is an unstable and tense personality, and this tension It will change his life badly. Because he is unable to make important decisions in his life, or he makes them and then returns to the decision he made, and this thing has physical consequences because it exposes him to failure in his life. The dream of shaving also indicates money and obtaining sources of income that provide the dreamer with all his needs that secure his future in a way that makes him give up About some work that does not suit him or match his ambitions. If a man dreams that he wants to cut his hair, but the scissors in his hand are not sharp enough to make the task of cutting his hair easy and comfortable, this means that this man wants to change his life for the better, but he cannot. He did it. Because the circumstances surrounding him disappoint him and never support him to achieve this. Cutting hair in a dream also indicates getting rid of the negative situation that the dreamer has been living in for a long time, getting rid of worries and problems, and restoring the spirit of will, adventure, and vitality that drives him to rise up and accomplish tasks. allocated to him. If a married woman sees that she has to cut a certain percentage of her hair, but she cuts a much larger percentage of her hair, this means that this woman is not a servant and a financial agent, but rather a spendthrift whom she cannot save. Money and saving from them. We find that the interpretation of a dream about shaving expresses a person who tends to vent his anger and replenish the energy that passes through his body by removing negative charges and attracting everything that is positive in his life. Seeing short hair in a dream but the dreamer has long hair in reality, and this It means that the dreamer will fall into a big problem or disaster that will lead to a serious shortage of his money and perhaps to poverty and the disappearance of this money. If one sees himself in the holy months and cutting his hair in a dream, then this vision is worthy of praise. Because it indicates the rejection of sins and disobedience and the payment of that man’s debts, and that God will hide him. When a man sees in a dream that he cuts all parts of his hair and does not find a hair on his head, this indicates that he is an honest and generous person, meaning that he gave everything he had to those around him, and did not find Something for himself until he got it.
