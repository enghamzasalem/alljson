Interpretation of a dream about a husband urinating on his wife by Ibn Sirin What is the interpretation of a dream about a husband urinating on his wife? If a woman is going through a miserable psychological state at that time due to her failure in her attempts to get pregnant, whether naturally or using modern methods such as IVF, for example, then her husband’s urine on her in her dream foretells that she will achieve this goal that has become unattainable and is approaching, but the imminent pregnancy will change her life and replace her sadness with joy, her pain with happiness. But if the husband cannot do this, he does not treat her in a way that pleases God, and may even deprive her of her marital rights with him, so that she feels very uncomfortable continuing her life with this corn. Therefore, the husband must be wiser and do everything in his power to please his wife. If he suppresses his urine voluntarily, he is trying to control his nerves with many annoying things that happen to him, especially in his family, but if he hides it until it stings and hurts, he is a person who sacrifices to the highest degree for the sake of the blessings of others. Interpretation of a dream about a husband urinating on his wife by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin said: The husband spares no effort in comforting his wife and children in material matters, he is very generous in spending on them, and does not leave them with demands, from necessities or luxuries, except that he has them and more. As for if the woman cleans a lot of urine in her sleep and cleans it with dirt, she deserves to be a good wife and an ideal mother for her children who learn from her all good morals, especially the girls among them. Among the bad things mentioned by the interpreters: If the husband urinates on his wife with blood, he does not respect the sanctities of God, and sleeps with her during forbidden times. As if she was in her period or during the day of Ramadan and they are fasting.
