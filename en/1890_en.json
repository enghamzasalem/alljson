            "html": " Interpretation of piercing the ears in a dream: The ear is the body organ that living organisms use to sense and distinguish sounds, and it is responsible for one of the most important human senses, which is hearing. A car accident or dogs barking and losing them leads to speech difficulties, so what does it symbolize? Interpretation of seeing a pierced ear in a dream? Interpretation of a dream of piercing an ear in a dream. Many interpretation scholars, led by Ibn Sirin and Nabulsi, have more than one interpretation of seeing a pierced ear in a dream, and their interpretation is due to the meaning that the ear symbolizes, and this becomes clear as follows: The ear symbolizes a wife or daughter, and seeing more than one ear indicates many wives in the dreamer’s life. It also indicates the pursuit of knowledge, a lot of money and high status, as it is interpreted as blind obedience, contented obedience, or a child. According to psychology, It is a symbol of the need to listen and talk less and for a person to be able to accept situations even if they are not compatible with his own perceptions and to be less dependent on his expectations and vision. Because if he follows his expectations and this expectation is disappointed, it may lead to depression, isolation and the loss of many opportunities through which many things could be achieved. On the other hand, it indicates an inexperienced and immature person, because the ear is the person who tends to listen all the time Without expressing an opinion, or who listens to imitation or follow without creating his own path for himself. . If you feel that your ear hurts, this indicates sad news. According to Al-Nabulsi, we find that the ear is the source of human consciousness, through which he can see even if he is blind. It is more coherent and powerful, which is why he said it is the mind. It also symbolizes the religion of the one who embraced it by listening to the heavenly message and meditating on its texts. It also indicates progress in struggle or growing old, when a child hears well or grows up or matures to deal with his new life after emerging from Have mercy on his mother. Whoever sees that his ear is healthy or his hearing is sound, this indicates his great knowledge, good religion, and closeness to God, or that the dreamer walks with the righteous, listens a lot to their conversations, and follows the truth in their words. And actions. An ear piercing in a dream is interpreted as going on a date with one of his relatives, which may be his daughter, as the piercing may be the result of a neck hanging. A piercing is an indication of advice, a commandment, or the presence of something that the individual needs to know in particular or symbols in his life They need to decipher it. If the piercing is in his right ear, this indicates his benefit in the afterlife, good neighborliness, knowledge of good news, and implementation of the commandment that he passed on to those close to him. It is the same interpretation of truth, but in this world and not in the afterlife. If the fortuneteller sees that his ear piercing is heavy, it is a sign of injustice, whether in the will he wrote, or in the trust he has, or in the division of his rights. Poor hearing is a sign of distance from God, attachment to the mortal world, preoccupation with obeying God’s commandments and lying. Whoever has only one ear to see him is a sign of the loss of a person close to the fortuneteller. ",
            "text": " Interpretation of piercing the ear in a dream The ear is the organ of the body that living organisms use to sense and distinguish sounds and is responsible for one of the most important human senses, which is hearing. A car accident or a dog barking and losing it leads to difficulties in pronunciation, so what does it symbolize? Interpretation of seeing a pierced ear in a dream? Interpretation of a dream about piercing the ear in a dream Many scholars of interpretation, headed by Ibn Sirin and Nabulsi, have interpreted the vision of a pierced ear in a dream for more than one interpretation, and their interpretation goes back to the meaning that the ear symbolizes, and this is clear as follows: The ear symbolizes the wife or daughter, and seeing more than one ear indicates the abundance of wives in the dreamer's life. It also indicates the pursuit of knowledge, a lot of money and a high position, as it is interpreted as blind obedience or contented obedience or a child. According to psychology, it is a symbol of the need to listen and reduce speech and for a person to be able to accept situations even if they are inconsistent with his own perceptions and to be less dependent on his expectations and vision. Because if he follows his expectations and this expectation is disappointed, it may lead to depression, isolation and the loss of many opportunities through which many things can be achieved. On the other hand, it refers to an inexperienced and immature person, because the ear is the person who tends to listen all the time without expressing an opinion, or who listens to tradition or following without creating his own path. If you feel that your ear hurts, this indicates sad news. According to Al-Nabulsi, we find that the ear is the source of human consciousness, through which he can see even if he is blind. It is more coherent and stronger, which is why he said that it is the mind. It also symbolizes the religion of the one who embraced it by listening to the heavenly message and contemplating its texts. It also refers to progress in the struggle or advancing in age, when the child hears well or grows up or matures to deal with his new life after leaving his mother's womb. And whoever sees that his ear is healthy or his hearing is healthy, this indicates his great knowledge, his good religion and his closeness to God, or that the seer walks with the righteous and listens a lot to their conversations and follows the truth in their words. And actions. Piercing the ear in a dream is interpreted as going on a date with one of his relatives, who may be his daughter, as the piercing may be the result of hanging the neck. The piercing is an indication of advice or a will or the presence of something that the individual needs to know in particular or symbols in his life that they need to decipher. And if the piercing is in his right ear, this indicates his benefit in the afterlife, good neighborliness, knowledge of good news, and the application of the will that he conveyed to those close to him. It is the same interpretation of the right, but in this world and not in the afterlife. And if the fortune teller sees that the piercing of his ear is heavy, it is a sign of injustice, whether in the will he wrote, or in the trust he has, or in the division of his rights. Weak hearing is a sign of distance from God, attachment to the mortal world, and preoccupation with obeying God’s commandments and lying. And whoever has only one ear sees it, it is a sign of the loss of someone close to the fortune teller "
