Because it urges you to be like him, and if the dead person is a human being, the bad traits and attributes also try to end you to become like him. Ibn Sirin also points out that if the dreamer is actually fighting for a specific thing or cause and sees the dead person in a dream, then this is clear and clear evidence that this thing that The dreamer's fight for him will end. And whoever sees in a dream that the dead person has returned to life, this means that the dreamer is in a state of despair at that time, but hope will be renewed in him again and his passion for life will return, according to Al-Azim's interpretation. The scholar Ibn Sirin. If the dreamer sees the deceased in a dream, but he is sad, then Ibn Sirin says in the interpretation of this vision that the deceased is sad because his debts have not been paid, and he may also be sad because of the poor condition of his family after him.
