The meaning of the eye in a dream. Ibn al-Nabulsi says about the meaning of seeing an eye in a dream that the eye shows the religion and insight of the person who He sees with him. If a man sees in a dream that his eyes are made of iron, this means that this person will reveal his secret to the public. But if one sees in a dream that the eye of a dead person has fallen into his lap, then this indicates the death of his brother or son. But if he sees in a dream that the eye of a dead person has fallen into his lap, this indicates the death of his brother or son. If one dreams that his eye is affected by conjunctivitis, this means that this person is deficient in religion, and if he sees that the dead person has removed his eye, this indicates the presence of a calamity. Thus, in a dream, it is a man’s religion and his insight with which he sees guidance and error. Whoever sees many eyes in his body, this is an increase in religion and righteousness. Whoever dreams of watching someone who curses, then deceives him and holds grudges against him. And if his stomach is broken and he sees his eyes in his stomach, then he is a heretic, according to the words of God Almighty: (He did not make God, the human being, has two hearts inside him). And if he sees a man’s eye or an animal’s eye on his shoulder, then he is affected by invisible money. The black eye is religion, the evil eye is the opposite of religion, and the blue eye is a heresy religion. The green eye is a religion that contradicts all religions, and the unity of Basra is worthy of praise for all people. Her weakness indicates her need for money because money is like an eye. If he sees his eyes lost, his children will die, and if he is oppressed, he will find someone to hold his hand. Whoever sees that his eyes are the eyes of another person, this indicates that his sight has gone and that there is someone to guide him. Whoever sees that his eyes are the eyes of another person, this indicates that his sight has gone and that there is someone to guide him. They fell in his lap. His brother, his son, and the like died, and the man appointed his son, his lover, or his religion. Whoever sees that his eyes are healed, his religion will be corrected, or his wealth will be improved. Whoever sees that his sight is deeper and stronger than he thinks, then his secret in his religion is better than his glory. Whoever dreams that his eyes are white, he will be sad or sad. He is separated from a person dear to him, and if he is worried, God will remove his worry and sadness. Anyone who sees with blue eyes is a criminal. Whoever sees that he eats a man’s eye eats his money. Whoever sees that his eye does not have an eyelash, then he lacks the law of God and religion, and if his enemy plucks it, he will reveal it. And if He saw that the lips of his eyes were white, then this indicates illness, and perhaps a dream of a beautiful eye indicates magic, death, life, or the entire family, relatives, or children. The eye is fatal from the derivative, and the eye is fatal, and if he has a sick son, wife, or lover, he recovers from the disease, and if he An infidel becomes a Muslim, and if he is poor, he becomes rich, and the eyes may appear narrow. If the eye moves to another part of the body, this indicates harm, and clouding of the eyes is evidence of the coming of suffering from God Almighty. And if he sees redness in his eyes, he will become angry or angry. Whoever dreams of being His eye is swollen, and a child is cut, then this is his pupil, and a swollen eye in a dream means a long life. Perhaps a misfortune will attract attention.
