If he is on a hill or a wall, then he is subject to a weak person who will disappoint him. Kneeling In a dream, it is evidence of faith in God and repentance for the sinner. Interpretation of a dream about Hajj in HajjPerhaps prostration and prostration indicate Hajj, according to the Almighty’s saying: (Purify My House for whoever circumambulates and whoever stands and whoever prostrates and prostrates). Perhaps bowing indicates following the Sunnah and accompanying the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, in Paradise, and bowing In a dream, it is a sign of victory. Evidence of repentance from sins, evidence of earning money, evidence of longevity, and evidence of salvation from dangers. Kneeling is a victory and justice in matters, and kneeling is a blessing that God has bestowed upon whoever sees it. And whoever sees: a golden brick bends a silver brick, and an honest person submits. For the evil man, and from prison to the cross, and submitting to a hypocritical people to the beating of strings, singing, and musical instruments. Interpretation of bowing of gratitude in a dream by Al-Nabulsi: Al-Nabulsi interprets bowing of gratitude in a dream as a sign of the end of a period full of worries and sorrow. Whoever finds in his dream that he is worshiping God with gratitude, this is a sign. However, his sadness was over. He lost his worry and was saved from many troubles. And God compensated him for it by filling his heart with legitimate money or good offspring. Seeing a bow of thanks in a dream, according to Al-Nabulsi’s vision, indicates that the dreamer has a strong faith in God and feels grateful for His blessings upon him. If If the dreamer is one of the people of the Dhimmah, then this dream is a sign that he will soon announce his conversion to Islam. If he is characterized by hypocrisy, he will repent of it and complete his speech. However, if he is a Muslim, then he will enjoy the company of righteous people. "
