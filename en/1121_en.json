The interpretation refers to what both the dreamer and his wife do in terms of failure in relation to the other, or a long-term journey for the husband. Losing the cloak is gossip and false statements against others, ignoring his ill health. His dream includes an indication of the obstacles and challenges he faces in his life journey, but it soon ends with the grace and mercy of God and also expresses his thoughts about something. Losing the cloak in a dream according to Ibn Sirin The dream according to Ibn Sirin includes elements of the dreamer’s hesitation and his inability to choose the reward.
