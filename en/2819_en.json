Ruqyah is one of the methods used for healing in the Qur’an and to protect the human soul from dangers and machinations that others may try to manage, in addition to many other benefits provided by legal ruqyah. Seeing legal ruqyah from a dead person in a dream is one of the dreams.

It is good news about alleviating distress or healing the sick person. Or for any of the reasons for ruqyah. The second issue: - Seeing someone reciting other than the words of God and not mentioning God, then this ruqyah is invalid.

If he sees that he is promoting a person or person to perform ruqyah according to what was stated in the correct ruqyah with the words of God, His verses, the hadiths of the Messenger, and supplications, then that person will be exempted from wherever he is. He feels pain if he is sick, sad, sad, or in a bad psychological state. Whoever sees a man reciting the ruqyah and the basmalah over a cup of water, and the dreamer drinks from it, this indicates recovery from illnesses and the removal of worry, envy, and the evil that the viewer is going through. Whoever sees An old man for whom the ruqyah is performed with the verses of God and the supplications related to the legal ruqyah, this indicates that the dreamer enjoys complete mental and physical health and is free of problems.
