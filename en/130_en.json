The king, the angry or smiling employer, the director fired me, and deprived me for Ibn Sirin and more. Interpretation of dreams for the work director in a dream, is one of the interpretations that all people around the world are looking for to know the future of the vision, as seeing the work director in a dream is one of the dreams that has a psychological aspect.
