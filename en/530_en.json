Angry, according to Ibn Sirin and others. Interpretation of anger in a dream. It is no wonder that the viewer has anger in a dream as well as in the waking state, because the feeling of anger is subject to causes and stimuli, including conscious and subconscious. Sometimes we see in a dream or feel the anger of another, a relative, a stranger, a friend, or a competitor, or we see that The other person in the dream is angry with us and we feel it through harsh looks or high voice tones or something like that. Between your feeling of anger towards another person or the feeling that this person is angry with you, there is a difference in interpretation or expression, and the dream interpreter cannot depict the feeling of anger in Dream only through supplementary data that will aid in understanding. The dream and its expression. Anger in visions is a negative emotion resulting from the accumulation or successive psychological crises, and the viewer seeks through this dream to get rid of or get rid of these feelings. Anger in a dream deserves praise if it is between loved ones and friends and in the interpretation it symbolizes the purity and purity of the relationship, especially if It was followed by reconciliation and reconciliation. Because this expresses the deepening of judgments and disagreements between the fortuneteller and the person who is angry with him, and perhaps anger in this context paves the way for a dispute or battle in its aftermath. We cannot rely here on Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of anger for two reasons, the first of which is that Ibn Sirin did not analyze the interpretation of emotions such as anger or sadness, and the reason is The second is that Ibn Sirin’s approach is based on symbolism and significance more than psychological analysis, and this is actually logical because the science of dream interpretation was not subject to the modern method until Sigmund Freud. Anger: If he becomes angry with a person for the sake of this world, then he is a man who neglects the religion of God.
