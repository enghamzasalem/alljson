If a woman dreams of seeing walnuts, then she is lucky and her zodiac sign will rise. Whoever dreams that he is on walnuts, then he is tied to an older, non-Arab person, and if he gets off of them, the relationship between him and his partner who is attached to him will not be complete. Interpretation of nuts in a dream by Ibn Sirin: If he sees that he hits the nut that moves and makes a sound, then if the nut moves, makes a sound, or plays with it, they accompany him, and the gambler wins his friend, and everything he plays is the same. If he is the owner, then the moon wins what he asked for, and the basis of all this is forbidden and corrupt. And if he sees that he is on the nut, It is connected to a huge blindness, and if he comes down from it, what is between him and that man will not be complete. He saw that he died due to his fall, and if he did not die due to his fall, he will be saved. Likewise, if he sees that his arms or legs are broken, he will perish and be afflicted with great calamity, but he will be saved after that. Every large tree that runs in the course of a walnut is attributed to its essence as a walnut to non-Arabs. Perhaps the tree also means that the woman waters it, carries it, and bears its fruit, and it may indicate shops, tables, slaves, servants, animals, livestock, and other places known for food and money, such as dumps and waste. Commercial shops, and perhaps they indicate religions and sects because God Almighty likened a good word to a good tree, which is the palm tree, and the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, began with the Muslim and the first tree. It caught fire in a dream, so it was the prayer he prayed for his nation. Interpretation of nuts in a dream YouTube "
