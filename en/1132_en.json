If a polytheist sees that he has converted to Islam, and sees that he is praying towards the Qiblah, or sees that he is grateful to God Almighty, then God will guide him to Islam. And if he is in the house of polytheism and sees in His dream that he converted to the land of Islam would have been urgent. And if a Muslim dreams that he has converted to Islam again, then he is safe from the worst, and any polytheist he sees in a dream, or someone else sees him in Paradise, or wearing silver bracelets, is converting to Islam. And whoever dreams of one of the polytheists as if he were dead, then he is alive, Then he surrenders, and likewise if he sees his open heart, or sees himself in a ship at sea, he surrenders. Whoever recites the Shahada of the People of Dhimmah in a dream, he will be relieved of his distress or guided through change if he chooses to do so.

Whoever enters will be safe from my punishment.” If the polytheist sees that he has converted to Islam, or sees that he is praying facing the Qiblah, or sees that he is thanking God Almighty, he will be guided to Islam. And if he was in the house of polytheism, and then sees in his dream that he has converted to the house of Islam, then he will die. Soon, because the abode of Islam is the abode of truth. If a Muslim sees in a dream as if he is saying, “I have converted to Islam,” then his affairs will be harmonious and his sincerity will be constant.
