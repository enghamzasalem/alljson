Interpretation of seeing the dead in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin says in one of his interpretations of seeing the dead in a dream that if the dreamer meets the dead in his sleep and the dead person wears white or green clothes and is smiling, this is evidence of the good end of the seer and his good work in this world and God's mercy in it, and if he sees in his dream that he visited the dead and walked behind him, this is evidence that the living have followed the dead in the past, and if someone sees in his dream that he visited his deceased mother, this is evidence of his feeling of loneliness, lack of connection and loss. Seeing the dead silent in a dream If one sees in a dream a dead person silent, this is evidence that there is something that the deceased was trying to tell him in his life, but the dreamer does not listen to him, and if he sees that the dead person appears with focus without speaking, this indicates that the monarch needs to reconsider some issues and decisions he has made. He recently got it and saw the dead person looking at the living person without speaking and silently showing some bad behavior that must be stopped without hesitation and regret, and if he looked and smiled, you must implement what the dead person asks of you literally because you are doing good. Interpreters have provided many interpretations of the dreams that people see while sleeping. "
