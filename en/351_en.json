A man's dreams show that he is a favorite person among people, because of his honesty and credibility, as people around him trust him fearlessly with their money. If someone sees in a dream that he has lost his wallet, this dream has bad connotations in his real life. It indicates the loss of happiness and stability from one's life for a period. Its loss may also mean that the person is exposed to bad things in his reputation and that people talk about him with everything that insults him, but if it is stolen from him in a dream, this means that he will suffer great injustice from someone, and he may be blamed for what is not in him. As for if someone else steals the fortune teller's money, this indicates that those around him hate him and do not hope for happiness for him. The new wallet in a man's dream indicates that God will grant him many good things without making an effort to obtain them. Seeing the loss of the wallet may indicate some problems in the family and that the dispute will intensify between him and one of his relatives in the coming period, so he must deal with these differences wisely, so as not to reach the point of alienation. Money falling from the dreamer's wallet during a dream indicates the extent of his wealth and that he will earn money as a result of a specific project that he will manage in the coming period. Interpretation of seeing a bag in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin believes that the interpretations differ according to the details of the vision, but in general, seeing a wallet requires optimism, as long as the dreamer does not lose it in his dream, and this is what Ibn Sirin came up with from the interpretations: The dream of a married woman indicates that a new diet is on its way to her and that God has blessed her with an imminent pregnancy. As for the man, the meaning of the dream is related to the money he gets from his work and in a short period of time. If someone finds an old, worn-out wallet, this is a sign that one of the parents is sick. As for the new wallet, it expresses, in Ibn Sirin's view, the death of one of the women in the dreamer's family and may also indicate many offers, whether job offers or marriage offers, depending on the dreamer's social status. There is also the bag that includes school pens, the vision of which indicates the dreamer's repentance and his heart's direction to the straight path of God, after living in a time of disobedience and sins. Interpretation of seeing a bag in a dream by Al-Nabulsi The Imam sees Al-Nabulsi said that this vision can be approached from more than one angle, depending on the condition of its owner. "
