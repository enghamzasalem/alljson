            "html": " Seeing walnuts in a dream for an unmarried girl, for a married woman, a pregnant woman, a divorced woman, for a man eating dry walnuts, walnuts, walnuts, green walnuts, they are picked from the walnuts, they give her to eat almonds and walnuts by Ibn Sirin Walnuts in a dream, one of the beautiful dreams that we constantly see in Our dreams, such as seeing walnuts, whole or grated, in a dream, promise many different associations and meanings. Through our topic today, we will learn about the interpretation of seeing walnuts in detail for a married and pregnant woman, as well as for an unmarried girl, as interpreted by the great translator Ibn Sirin in his works. Interpretation of nuts in a dream Sheikh Al-Nabulsi mentioned the dream interpretation of seeing walnuts in a dream and said that walnuts in a dream are valuable money. Who dreams It is on a walnut, then it is attached to a large foreign man, and if it falls from it, it will not complete what is between it and its owner who is attached to it, and if it falls from it, it dies, then it is in front of a huge man or a king, and if the tree is broken, this huge man is lost, and he can see that he died when he fell. Yam survived. Whoever sees in a dream that he is cutting a nut kills a non-Arab, and the fruits of walnuts are money that cannot be eaten except with toil and toil, for walnuts are not eaten until they crack, and their fat is eaten. . It comes out only by pressing. Whoever dreams that he has collected walnuts from the orchard, then he will earn money from the woman. If he eats the shells of the nuts, then he is stingy with the miser. Whoever dreams that he is playing with walnuts, then deals with forbidden money. Walnuts represent righteous people, presidents, and brothers, and this is interpreted by the health of the body and the length of the journey. If you dream that you are eating this delicious fruit, you will fulfill a cherished dream and gain in your business after failure. If you dream of this fruit while it is still on the plant, it means that you will live a long life in peace. If you see this fruit spoiled, you will fail in business. Your emotional relationship: If the fruit is small and difficult to break, you will succeed after a lot of effort, expenses, and abundant profits. Interpretation of walnuts in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin interprets seeing nuts as joy and happiness in the dreamer’s life. It also symbolizes money and abundance of livelihood for the dreamer, God willing.
