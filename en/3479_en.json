And Al-Nabulsi, Ibn Shaheen and other scholars. Interpretation of a dream about death in a dream according to Ibn Sirin. Death in a dream is a person’s grief over a great matter, so whoever sees that he died and then lives, then commits a sin and then repents, based on the Almighty’s saying: It is neither a disease nor a form; And longevity. The great scholar Ibn Sirin explained death, its forms and rulings in more than one way according to the state of the dreamer, including: Interpretation of a dream about the death of oneself. Whoever sees that he has died and sees his death as a funeral, gathering, washing, and shrouding, his earthly life is safe and his religion is corrupt. And whoever dreams that he died while he was naked on the ground is poor. And God knows best. And since whoever dreams as if he died and did not see the body of the dead person or their equipment, then this means the demolition of his house or a wall or a house unless it is in the hands of someone else. As for whoever dreams that he is wrapped in a shroud as a dead person is wrapped, then his dream indicates his death, if he does not cover his head. And his feet, it is corruption in his religion. Above the dead is closer to repentance. See also: Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of seeing an acrobat in a dream. Interpretation of a dream of the same person in the grave. The scholar Ibn Sirin explained seeing the same person inside the grave as if he was buried in his grave but without death. The indications of seeing him are that his burial will crush him or imprison him, and whoever sees that the grave is dead. After that, he died, worrying, just as whoever did not see death in the grave escaped from that imprisonment and injustice, and some commentators said: Whoever is buried has corrupted his religion, then he sees himself coming out of the grave. After they buried him, this indicates that he will condemn him to perdition, and if he sees that he has been placed in the grave and this is on his behalf, then he will obtain a house and the amount of land on which the money is calculated. And God Almighty knows best. Interpretation of a dream about graves. Ibn Sirin interpreted the vision of a dug grave originally as a prison in the interpretation, as the prison is the grave. God knows best. As for whoever sees himself in a grave, the indications for this are that he is committing a sin according to the Almighty’s words: (And do not stand in his grave), and whoever sees a rich person in a graveyard. He wanders around the graves and revives them. It is said that he is bankrupt and asks people why the cemetery is a place of bankruptcy. Whoever sees the dead as if they are alive, his conditions will improve after corruption and difficulty. It follows easily and from where he does not expect it. If he sees a living person dead, his condition will be difficult for him, because life is easy and death is difficult. He sees them moving away from him, which indicates his bad condition. Interpretation of the dream of someone who sees it raining on graves, having mercy on their families. If he sees a grave in an unknown place, he will mix with the pretender. The grave of the dead person is transported to his house, to his house, or to his country, because after him they build a house there, as does someone who sees that he has entered a grave without being at a funeral. He bought a house that was completed. See also: Interpretation of a dream about a married woman crying in a dream. Interpretation of washing a dead person by Ibn Shaheen.
