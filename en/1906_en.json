            "text": " Bag in a dream: Seeing a bag is considered puzzling by many of them, and it is also a matter of disagreement among jurists. They went on to say that the interpretation of this vision is determined by what is in the bag of good or evil, and according to the value of these things and the extent of their benefit or harm to the viewer, and in this article we examine all of them. The indicators and special cases of the bag that we dream about in more detail and explanation, and we also explain the details that affect negatively or positively in the context of the dream. The bag in a dream: Seeing the bag expresses the things it contains. If a person looks at it and finds what makes him happy, then this is goodness and food that he accumulates, and benefits that he enjoys and fears in his heart, but if he finds in it what harms him and saddens him, then this is victory. Worries, excessive sorrows and fluctuations in life. The bag, from a psychological point of view, symbolizes the one who keeps secrets, keeps the covenant, and stores what will be useful to him when needed, and the one who carries the bag is preparing for a big matter and may complicate the intention of traveling. Or traveling to another place. And whoever sees that he is traveling without bags, this indicates that he has left the world, and the term is approaching, and whoever sees that he is putting the bag on his head, he has seen a secret and is hiding it with difficulty, and the harm from the bag is interpreted as leaking a secret and spreading it around the circles.

An annoying guest or neighbor, because it interprets burdens, worries, and sins. This vision also indicates pregnancy or imminent pregnancy, if the woman is able to do so, and if the bag is empty, this indicates a man who has no secrets or what he keeps from others, and one of his qualities is tolerance. Among his qualities is tolerance. He sees that he is carrying many bags, so he carries more than they can accommodate, and if the bag is lost, this indicates bad news and bitter adventures in life, and if his bag is stolen, he can also trust his secret in it. Whoever betrays him and betrays him. If a person finds a bag and returns it to its owner, this indicates that things will return to their normal course, and the vision indicates knowing the secret and informing its owner, and in the event that the bag is destroyed. This indicates the transfer of secrets from one person to another and the arrival of bad news. The bag in a dream according to Al-Osaimi. Al-Osaimi goes on to say that the bag indicates pregnancy, or what a person hides in his stomach, or what secrets he keeps that he does not reveal, or what is tied around his neck, and the bag is evidence of responsibilities and heavy burdens. Problems and difficulties of life and sudden changes. Whoever sees that she is carrying a bag, this indicates that she moves frequently from one place to another, and she may decide to travel in the near future, and if she is not married, she can move to another place.
