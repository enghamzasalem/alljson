If the ring is borrowed in a dream From another person, this symbolizes the dreamer owning things that are not his right.

Whereas if the dreamer sees in his dream a ring made of gold or mostly iron, there will certainly be hatred and resentment for the dreamer. As for the presence of the copper ring in the vision, its interpretation is also reprehensible. This is because Ibn Sirin confirmed that the ring is silver.
