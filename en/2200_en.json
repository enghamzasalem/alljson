            "html": " We present to you the interpretation of garlic and its effects in reality, as garlic is one of the plants that bring countless benefits to the human body and protect it from infections from many diseases, in addition to giving a good taste to food because it has a strong smell. But garlic is one of the dreams whose meaning we do not know and we do not know whether it is good for the dreamer or indicates that something bad will happen to him or it differs according to the case, whether in eating garlic, peeling or cutting it, but the encyclopedia provides you with the meaning of this dream according to Ibn Sirin and Ibn Shaheen. What is the interpretation of garlic in a dream according to Ibn Sirin? Ibn Sirin gave different interpretations of this dream in the following cases: Whoever sees in a dream that he is eating uncooked garlic, this indicates the corruption of the dreamer and the theft of his money in reality. Seeing peeling garlic in a dream means that the dreamer enjoys a good reputation in reality. Ibn Sirin narrated that cooked garlic in a dream indicates repentance from the dreamer's sin in reality. Cutting garlic in a dream symbolizes the loss of a family member and may indicate disobedience to parents. And whoever was sick and saw in his dream that he was eating garlic, this indicates his recovery from his illness, and God knows best. In the best of this vision, Ibn Sirin interpreted the consumption of cooked garlic as a sign of regaining health and well-being if the dreamer is suffering from illness. Imam Ibn Sirin also mentioned that eating cooked garlic in a dream indicates the dreamer's desire to repent and stay away from forbidden things.
