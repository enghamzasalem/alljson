The meaning of impurity in a dream: impurity is what requires washing from the emission of semen, whether through intercourse, masturbation, or wet dreams. The presence of this symbol in a dream has specific connotations, as it is, as the first of them, Jafar al-Sadiq. Three aspects: the child, the acquisition of money and the exchange of money. Interpretation of dreams for the dream of impurity by Ibn Shaheen: Whoever dreams that he has become part of something forbidden, he is confused in his affairs and it is said that he travels and does not achieve what he wants and does not achieve his purpose. On that trip. He did not get what he wanted, and it was said: precum is more than money, precum is money that does not save him, and the semen remains. It is interpreted as money from treasure and yellow sperm, as it is a child with many diseases, as for a red child, it is short-lived, and as for a black child, his family will suffer. If he said that I saw that my sperm came out, then this is the flow of money, and if he said that the sperm came to me, then it is money, and the meaning is the same, and the difference in speech. Al-Nabulsi interpreted the dream of impurity in a dream as being in a dream of the state of impurity, which is a need that he did not perform ablution for. Postpone it. For whoever sees it. Whoever dreams that he has become junub and does not take water to wash him, then the necessary matters of this world and the hereafter will be difficult for him.
