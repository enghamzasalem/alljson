            "text": "Seeing mussels in a dream indicates concern for someone, and other interpretations. We will explain it for the single woman, the married woman, the pregnant woman, the divorced woman, and the man, such as seeing mussels and seafood for Ibn Sirin and more in the continuation of the topic: Mussels are a type of shellfish found in the sea and on the seafood restaurant menu. The interpretation of mussels in a dream: Seeing mussels in a dream indicates attention to some people in your environment, and if the mussels in the dream are clean or pure, then this indicates tensions and quarrels in the family environment. Seeing cooked mussels in a dream is a good omen, while eating mussels in a dream is not good. Opening mussels in a dream means that you will achieve success that will come through the bad behavior of others. Catching mussels in a dream symbolizes health, and as for buying mussels, big expenses await you. Seeing mussels in a dream means that the dreamer will deeply regret the action he has taken, and it may cause some losses to others and damage some valuable things. Seeing mussels in a dream means that you are acting wisely to prevent harm, and this vision means that the visionary will receive praise from some people. Anyone who sees a dream about mussels means that he will start (without thinking) a business project or enter a business, but this project or work will be completely unsuccessful and will hurt him from the beginning. This vision also means that the dreamer will start to make great efforts to get out of this situation safely. Seeing mussels in a dream indicates the difficult and harsh situation that the dreamer will face due to unexpected problems. It indicates that the matter has turned into a crisis and a major disagreement between the visionary and someone in the house, and it also indicates that things will become more confusing than you expected and you will make every effort to find solutions for it. The interpretation of mussels in a dream by Ibn Sirin: A dream about mussels is usually a very good omen, and mussels symbolize strength, peace, fertility, and profitable seasons. But be careful when thinking about your dream, as mussels can be a sign of loss, betrayal, and heartbreak. Positive changes in your life will be in full swing if you open the mussels and they are full and fresh from the inside. If you were given mussels from someone and they were full or contained a pearl, then this indicates the arrival of happiness and finding the right partner who has all the qualities you want.

So he sent Ibn Ruwahah and said: Shake them.  So they shook them, and they were not satisfied.  So he sent to Ka’b bin Malik.  Then he sent to Hasan bin Thabit.  When he came to him, Hasan said: It is time to send this lion who whips his tail.  Then he stuck out his tongue and moved it.  He said: To whom did you send with the truth!  To the skin, pour them out empty of the idol.  The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Do not rush.  Abu Bakr is the most knowledgeable of Quraysh about their lineage.  And I have their ancestors.  So to summarize it for you.  Hasan missed him.  Then he turned and said: O Messenger of Allah!  Your lineage has been summarized for me.  He is the one who sent you with the truth!  I will bring you out of them like a hair from dough.

            "text": "Seeing a lion in a dream can mean danger, illness, and other interpretations. We will explain it for a single woman, a married woman, a pregnant woman, a divorced woman, and a man, such as a dream of a lion attacking me, or seeing a small lion escaping or a tame and peaceful lion, or seeing a lion in the house. For the great dream interpreters Ibn Sirin, Imam Al-Sadiq, Al-Nabulsi and Fahd Al-Asimi and others, in detail in the appendix to the article: The Interpretation of the Lion in a Dream by Fahd Al-Asimi. Seeing a lion in a dream, like other symbols, can have multiple meanings depending on the time and circumstances of the dreamer. Among the most important things that are said about it are the following: Lions in a dream can mean, in seeing them, staying away from the remembrance of God, abandoning the work of the teachings of religion, and reflecting on the verse: As if they are red-hot, fleeing from the palaces, and the sura is a lion, as Abu Hurayrah and others have interpreted it. Seeing lions can indicate a dangerous journey, especially for travelers, and can mean that there are bad deals from customs, for example, or at the borders from which the traveler will leave, because the lion in nature plays roles similar to these roles. Seeing a lion in a dream means that the dreamer may face a serious and fatal illness or fever, and it is known that lions do not leave them with fever, which is scientifically proven, but also because of the origin of evil from the word \"asad\" (lion) and its plural \"asud\" (lions). The saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, supports this: From Aslam, the freedman of Umar: When Noah entered the ark, two from each pair said: How do we be sure, or how can the animals be sure that the lion is with us? So God gave him fever, and it was the first fever that came down to the earth. Narrated by Ibn Kathir. The meaning of seeing a lion in a dream can also be a sign of a journey that changes the color of one's skin to brown. This is due to the possibility of being extracted and exhausted, so blackness and the lion, individually and collectively, have similarities in wording. The dream of the lion can have among its meanings accompanying those who are not skilled, those with hard hearts and those with wild tempers, due to the link between the fierceness of the lion and its nature and its nature in reaching the vision. The presence of a lion in your dream may indicate the presence of a contagious disease or epidemic that needs to be warned and cared for, and to look at the following hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih from the authority of Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, saying: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Do not touch a contagious disease, nor a bird, nor a pest, nor a yellow fever, run away from the leper as you run away from the lion. Seeing a lion can indicate harsh words and a sharp tongue, look at the hadith below to understand the connection between this meaning and this symbol. And it was narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, was angry with Quraysh and ordered that they be satirized. “It is more difficult for them than to be beaten by the nobles. So he sent Ibn Ruwah, and he said: Scare them. And he scared them, but they were not satisfied. So he sent Ka’b ibn Malik. Then he sent Hasan ibn Thabit. And when he came to him, Hasan said: The time has come to send this lion whose tail is lashed. Then he put out his tongue and moved it. He said: Who sent you with the truth! For the skin, show them barren of balsam. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Do not hurry. Abu Bakr is the most knowledgeable of Quraysh about their ancestry. And about their forefathers. So, to summarize it for you. Hasan missed it. Then he turned and said: O Messenger of Allah! Your lineage has been summarized for me. He is the one who sent you with the truth! I will bring you out of them like a hair from dough. Aisha said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say to Hasan: The Holy Spirit supports you as long as you are calling upon God and his Messenger. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: Hasan has calmed them down, so he is healed and healed. Hasan said: I satirized Muhammad, and I answered him, and by God in this reward. I satirized Muhammad the just Messenger of Allah, his faith, his father, and my honor with the honor of Muhammad. I protect you. My daughter, I am sorry if you do not see her stirring the dates with her hand like a sickly one. Comparing the tinkling with the elevator, on their shoulders the thirsty donkey. Our arrows rain down continuously, and they are filled with wine by the women. If we had been away from them, we would have performed the Umrah, and it was the opening and the cover. Otherwise, be patient with the strike of the day on which God will honor whom he pleases. And God said: I have sent a servant who speaks the truth without concealment. And God said: An army made easy for you is the Ansar, I have shown them to you for a meeting. Every day, we have insults or quarrels or satire. So, whoever mocks you, the Messenger of Allah, his praise and support him. Gabriel, the Messenger of Allah, is among us, and the Holy Spirit is unparalleled. On the Prophet, peace be upon him, he said: You are healed, O Hasan, and you are healed. A lion in a dream can refer to a harmful and corrupt animal, especially if it is seen by the owners of farms or farmers. And it has been proven with authenticity from Abu Hurayrah that the lion is the poisonous dog. Narrated by Imam Ibn Hazm - as in Al-Mahalla - the page or number: 7/241, so in his view, there is a harmful or harmful animal to humans. This saying is supported by what the Prophet, peace be upon him, narrated that he was asked about the poisonous dog, and he said: It is the lion. One of the meanings of seeing it is also the existence of laxity in looking at the forbidden for the dreamer or whoever enters his house, and this has been proven in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him: Beware of looking at forbidden things, beware of the lion, and it has been narrated reliably, and this meaning is one of the meanings that I find most applicable to seeing the lion at this time, especially for women. It is also one of the meanings of seeing it the emergence of some wonderful signs or excellent worldly fortune, and reflect on what Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, narrated with a good chain of narrators on the authority of the Prophet, peace be upon him. And God bless him and grant him peace. He said: The son of Mary will descend as a righteous leader and a righteous judge, and they will break the cross and kill the pig, and they will return peace and they will take swords as knives, and they will demolish every block. Their food will descend from heaven, and their blessing will rise from the earth, until the boy plays with the snake and it does not harm him, and he will graze sheep and the wolf and it will not harm them, and he will graze the lion and the cows and it will not harm them. Look also at what Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, narrated: Blessed is the life after the Messiah, and blessed is the life after the Messiah, the sky is called for rain, and the earth is called to sprout, so if you plant your love in the earth, it will grow, and it does not envy or hate. Or hated, until the man passes by the lion and it does not harm him, and he tramples the snake and it does not harm him, he does not argue, he does not envy or hate. Al-Albani - source: The Correct Chain - page or number: 1926: Its chain is correct. Among the meanings that I prefer in this symbol, the existence of a service given to the vision from an influential person, such as princes and ministers, for example. And the word “lion” can be compared to our saying: “A lion does a favor.” Think about it to discover the connection between what I said and what I concluded. It also has good meanings, especially when seen in winter: improving the viewer's health and the disappearance of symptoms of diseases that afflict people, especially in winter, such as influenza, for example. In addition to that, one of its meanings is the presence of an enemy who is controlled by everyone according to his situation, especially for the oppressed, so beware of seeing the lion in a dream, for it may be behind him. It is a call to the oppressed. \n"
