            "html": " Dream of a scorpion, whether black, white, yellow, large, small scorpion, for a married girl, a divorced pregnant woman, for a married and single man, the meaning of a scorpion bite There is no doubt that the scorpion is one of the most dangerous reptiles, and everyone is afraid of it and feels fear when they see it even if they see it in a dream. Interpretation of dreams There is no general interpretation for any dream. Interpretation of a dream of a scorpion in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin said in his interpretation of seeing a scorpion in a dream that it is something hateful, as he explained that the dreamer saw a scorpion in his dream and the person was able to kill the scorpion and burn it with fire. Seeing a scorpion in a dream can indicate the presence of money. If a person kills a scorpion, this means that his money has been lost. If the scorpion returns again and stings the person in the dream, this means that there is money, but it is temporary and does not last long. As for the person who dreams that he saw a scorpion nesting in his clothes or in the butterfly, this means that the person will face corruption from his wife. Ibn Sirin interprets the scorpion as a mutant, a man who kills some of his relatives. If he dreams that a scorpion has been burned by fire, his enemy will die. If he sees that he took a scorpion and threw it at his wife, he commits an obscenity on her part, and the jar is the most hostile. If he sees a scorpion in his pants, this indicates the corruption of his wife and also if he sees it in his bed. If he sees that he swallowed a scorpion, this leads to a secret for his enemy. If he sees scorpions in his stomach, they are his enemies among his relatives, and if he eats scorpion meat, he has taken forbidden money from an enemy of gossip due to inheritance or other. Al-Nabulsi interpreted the dream of a scorpion in a dream: that in a dream it indicates the anxiety and temptation of a person who returns to life, and the scorpion is the person who gossips among people, and the scorpion sting is a virtue. It receives a single person. If the scorpion hits him, the enemy harms him, or harms him, and burning scorpions in his house is the death of his enemies. If he eats cooked or grilled scorpion meat, he will get money from a gossipy enemy, as a legitimate inheritance. If it is raw, it is forbidden. If he sees a scorpion on his shirt or in his shop, it is an enemy and they are in living and earning. If he sees it in his bed, it is an enemy and it is in his family. If he sees scorpions in his stomach, then their enemies are from his workers. If it comes out from inside it, then his enemies are from his grandchildren or hostility between them, and whoever eats a raw scorpion shows a corrupt person, and the scorpion shows a man who does not know his friend from his enemy. The scorpion is the enemy of weak determination and laziness. Whoever sees that he killed a scorpion, he triumphs over his enemy. Whoever dreams that he has a scorpion in his hand that stings people is one who supports people and annoys each other. Whoever sees something like a scorpion but not a scorpion, he is a man who thinks he is his enemy but is not an enemy, and the scorpion's sting is the tongue of slander.
