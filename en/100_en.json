I chase a dog, I attack black or white dogs, a small puppy barks or a dog bites by Ibn Sirin and others in continuation of the topic: Interpretation of a dog in a dream The dog differed in its interpretation, some of them said that he is a slave, and they said that he is a tyrannical man, stupid and shameful if he barks. The black man is an Arab, and he is a weak enemy, lacking in courage, and a prostitute is a despicable woman. Whoever has his dog tear his clothes, his honor will be torn by the scoundrel. He who eats dog meat appears above an enemy who takes his money and drinks his milk in fear. And whoever leans on a dog, the dog is a friend who seeks victory with him and seeks its help. The dog indicates a guard and this is an innovation. And whoever is bitten by a dog If he is accompanied by heresy, he will be tempted. If he had an enemy or opponent who insulted him or defeated him, and if he had a servant who betrayed him, or a guard who betrayed him. And if this was in a time of hunger, then something befell him, then it reached the extent of a bite and his pain. A bitch is a despicable woman from among the evil ones. The dog is A foolish man, and a shepherd takes money from a boss, and a dog is an unjust enemy, and a dog that knows helps its owner against his enemies, but it is evil and has no chivalry. It was said that the owner of this vision will gain strength and mastery in life. Some of them said: Dogs in interpretation are a sign of harm, unhappiness, and illness. The enemy is only one part, and he is the one who takes the toy and the scratch, because he announces life with pleasure and enjoyment, and the water dog is a vain hope and an unfinished business. And all breeds of dogs show popular hatred. On the authority of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, he saw in his dream in the year of the conquest between Mecca and Medina in his dream that the Messenger of God May God bless him and grant him peace, he had to approach Mecca with his companions, and a dog with a foal came out to them. When they approached him, he lay on his back, and the doctors were milking him. He narrated his visions to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and he said: He left their dog, and a dirham came, and they ask you for a relative when you meet. You meet Abu Sufyan bin Harb, so do not kill him. And whoever turns into a dog, God will teach him great knowledge, then take it away from him, according to the Almighty’s words: “And announce to them the news of Our signs, so stay away from them.” He narrated that a man saw that they were two dogs scattering in his wife’s lap. He narrated his vision. At a crossroads, he said: This is a woman who wanted to shave, but the razor could not. So he cut it with scissors, so the man came home and felt his wife’s vagina and found the scissor mark. Dogs represent loyalty and protection, and also indicate someone you can rely on. Seeing a dog in its normal size and calm state indicates a sincere and sincere friendship that the dreamer may have. Seeing dogs fighting with each other in a dream means Conflicts that you may face or witness in your environment If you see a black dog running after you in a dream, this may indicate a challenge that you may be exposed to and may also indicate an enemy that is chasing you or envying you.
