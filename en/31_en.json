It is possible that the car accident in the dream reflects an event that will completely change your life. \n\nAnd if you have problems with your colleagues or partner, the car accident in the dream is a reflection of the ongoing conflict with others. And if the car accident caused it to fall into the water, this indicates that you are suffering from psychological problems, and water is said to represent emotions. Drowning dreams indicate feelings of anxiety and panic.\n\nAlso, the road where the accident occurred, if the road was rough, this indicates that you feel you are deviating from your goal. And if you are driving the car without the headlights on, this means that you do not have enough information to make your decisions.\n\nIbn Sirin says in his interpretation of a car accident in a dream that the person who dreams of driving a car very fast in his dream means that he will receive good news soon. Ibn Sirin explained that the person who dreamed that he was driving his car in the dream but lost control while driving and had an accident, this indicates that this person is unstable in his real life and needs to choose the right path. The car shows your progress in the world, and the accident is obstacles, worries, and problems that guide you in life, and God knows best.\n\nWhoever does not survive the accident in the dream will suffer from the plots of enemies, their money will be stolen, and their reputation will be tarnished. The car accident in the dream shows anxiety, complicated things, fatigue, and worry, and shows haste and rushing into making decisions and taking actions. And dreaming of an accident and blood indicates loss, weakness, and exhaustion. Traffic accidents can indicate family disputes, hasty judgment of matters, fears, and lack of confidence. Often, the car in a dream refers to your life, the meaning of your ordinary day and the activities you do during the day (your daily lifestyle). So, if you dream that you are driving a car and lose control of it and this leads to an accident, this means that you do not like who you are, and the way you are living your life. Therefore, wiser decisions need to be made to be able to face your life’s problems.\n\nAnd if you dream that someone else is driving a car and you are with him and he loses control while driving, this means that there is someone else forcing you to make decisions you do not want and plays a negative role in your life. So you must realize that your life is your life, not someone else’s life, and do not let anyone else guide you on your path. All you have to do is make the best decisions for yourself and control your life.\n\nThe dream interpreter al-Nabulsi says that if you see yourself driving a car and you cannot easily control it, this means that you cannot control your life and you feel insecure, or you feel a great responsibility towards your life and matters. And dreaming that the car is very fast means that I heard surprising news. And seeing a car accident in a dream, if he did not see blood in the dream, this means that a good situation will happen soon, and this dream also shows the many changes in the work environment. But if there is blood in the accident in the dream, it shows the amount of regret the person will feel, and that he keeps a secret, and at the same time expresses some problems in relationships with a lover or spouse. For this reason, he will have to face some crises. If the car involved in the accident is the person’s own car, this means that he will spend the family’s income on trivial things and be exposed to a lot of stress. But if you encountered a car accident in your dream or anything else, this means that you will face disappointment in work or a dangerous event. And if the girl saw it and witnessed it, this means that there will be more than one person who wants her, and she is confused between them, so quarrels and conflicts will occur for her.\n\nSeeing a car accident in a dream disturbs the dreamer, and there are different interpretations, including the psychological interpretation. Psychologists have said that road accidents are related to a person’s lifestyle and way of life. If a person dreams that he is driving his car in a dream but loses his balance and control of the car, causing an accident, this indicates that there is a reflection of a person’s real life, which is that his lifestyle and pattern are not suitable for him, so this person should turn to another path that he follows in life that is more beneficial and suitable for him. But if someone dreams that someone else is driving the car next to him and he loses control and an accident happens in the dream, this means that this person who owns the dream has a negative personality in his life, and there is someone else who is making decisions for him, whether ordinary or fatal, so this person must change his lifestyle and rely on himself in making his decisions.\n\nSeeing an accident in which people are seriously injured indicates that you are involved in something that causes you problems and you cannot get out of it. – And the worst thing about the accident dream is that whoever does not survive the accident in the dream will suffer from the plots of enemies, they will steal his money, and his reputation will be tarnished. Dreaming of an accident may indicate a material problem that may affect the dreamer in real life. Car accident… \n"
