            "html": " Welcome to the Dream Interpretation website. This meeting of ours focuses on the interpretation of seeing a niece in a dream or a niece in a dream. Through it, we seek to highlight the most important meanings and connotations that indicate the appearance of a niece in a dream. This article falls within a series of interpretations that mean the appearance of relatives, parents, or family members in a dream. Interpretation of the appearance of a niece in her uncle's dream The interpretation of the appearance of a niece in her uncle's dream depends on the relationship or ties that bind the uncle to his sister. The better, friendlier, or respectful this relationship is, the more the dream carries very positive messages. If the niece appears in a dream, beautiful or elegant, with a beautiful appearance and clothes, the dream indicates that the dreamer will suffer in the near future. The best visions are those in which nieces appear happy and smiling. This is interpreted as happy news and events that overwhelm the dreamer and relieve his heart from some of his worries and problems. The dreamer can deduce the meaning of the dream in which his niece appears through her name and the best names (Fatima, Aisha, Surur, Madiha, Ahlam, Marwa, Jihan, Basma, Latifa, Munia, Salma, Samia, Raja, Zahra). If the niece appears in her uncle's dream wearing the veil, this is a good interpretation, because it expresses the veil of livelihood or religion, and its interpretation is sometimes marriage. The niece in the dream of her unmarried aunt The niece often appears in the dreams of an unmarried girl, and often a young girl or a newborn appears, and the reason for her appearance in the dream is the connection of the unmarried aunt who dreamed of her. Sometimes her appearance is purely symbolic, meaning that the niece in a dream can symbolize a happy event or news if she enjoyed and played in the dream. It is not good to see her in a miserable or sad state, and it is not good to see her lost, kidnapped or hidden, and her illness in a dream is not good, as well as falling from a height, and it is good to see an unmarried woman, beautiful, friendly, smiling so that her dream has positive dimensions. The niece in a dream married her aunt The niece appears in a married dream in different states or forms, and sometimes the married woman feels that the one she sees in the dream is her daughter and not her niece! And sometimes she sees that she is breastfeeding her while she is young, and this dream has a special interpretation, as it shows the impossibility of marrying her niece to the dreamer's son. Sometimes, caring for the niece indicates food or money that can be gained from marriage or travel. When the niece appears beautiful, elegant, clean and cheerful, and the married woman sees that she enters her house and contaminates part of her livelihood or food, or even sits with her and speaks with kind words and understanding, this is very good. The interpretation shows that the doors of the world are open to the owner of the dream or to the dreamer's husband and children, as it is possible that good news and perhaps a wish will knock on her. It becomes a reality for her in her mind, and perhaps her aunt’s house has witnessed a joy she has never seen before, and the important thing is that the vision expresses goodness.
