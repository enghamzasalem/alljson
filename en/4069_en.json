He said, peace be upon him: (Whoever reads a letter from the Book of God will have a good deed and a good deed ten times greater than it. I do not say “wa’ is a letter, but rather alif is a letter, laam is a letter, and meem is a letter), and Surat An-Najm has a special value in that, according to what the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said. In this regard: (Whoever reads Surah Al-Najm will be given ten good.
