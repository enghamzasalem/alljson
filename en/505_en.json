Interpretation: The meaning of the market and the bank in the dream. The bank: It may indicate a loan, or it may indicate wealth or the need for others. Interpretation of seeing banks and banking transactions in a dream. Money in a person’s dream expresses psychological strength. And energy, and the interpretation of the dream differs from money or banking depending on the form in which the individual acts in his dream. Seeing a bank in a dream indicates psychological pressure or going through a difficult situation that requires the dreamer to act wisely and control his accounts in an accurate and effective way. Money and securities are interpreted And all types of documents circulating in banks are mostly depicted as the psychological energy, emotions, feelings and sentiments of the person and not the actual bank money. Depositing an amount of money in a bank account can be interpreted as a transfer of positive energy towards a humanitarian or social project, the benefit of which is double for the viewer. Withdrawing amounts is interpreted From bank accounts, it is evidence of a state of weakness that the viewer is exposed to after all his material and moral capabilities have ended. Seeing things in a bank or bank has valuable meanings and value, not just jewelry, safes, and bonds. For example, a fortuneteller may see in a dream a person in the bank who has realistic value to the viewer and seeing him in the dream indicates the need to maintain a good relationship with him or turn it into a relationship of friendship, marriage, kinship, or any relationship that benefits the individual.
