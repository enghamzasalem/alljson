            "html": " Ladies and gentlemen, hello and welcome to the Dream Interpretation website. In this meeting, we will discuss the interpretation of long nails in a dream, and we will also look at the most important clues, whether it is a single girl, a married woman, or a man. We wish you all the best in this matter. Interpretation of long nails in a dream in general: Long nails indicate status, power and gains and are highly praised in women’s dreams, provided that these nails look clean and healthy. Some interpreters dislike the length of toenails because they often symbolize anxiety, especially if they appear dirty in a dream. Interpretation of long nails in a dream for a single woman: Long nails are one of the standards of beauty and at the same time express a girl’s confidence and self-esteem, and long nails also express The femininity of a woman. The longer the nails are in a dream does not indicate positive intentions. An unmarried woman who sees in her dream that the nails have grown in beauty and length, then in waking life she can achieve what she desires. Long nails portend good developments, God willing, provided that these nails are healthy and clean. Health, cleanliness, and beauty are considered good omens in visions. If the fingernails and toenails are long and dirty, the dream may express the accumulation of worries and problems, and sometimes dirty nails indicate many sins and mistakes, And a decline in feelings. Interpretation of long nails in a dream for a married woman: It is a good interpretation for a married woman to see in her dream as if her nails were long because it may represent more material gains, and perhaps long nails show the good position of the woman in the family or social environment. It is also praiseworthy in expressing the vision that she sees. A married woman looks after her fingernails and toenails. Care represents the renewal of a woman's psychological energy. The longer, smoother and cleaner a woman's nails are, the more positive its meaning. The dream is interpreted according to the woman's ambitions and desires. For example, if a married woman seeks to improve her financial situation and sees in her dream that her nails have developed, then her goal in waking life may be achieved, but if she sees them broken or broken, the dream may express her disappointment, disillusionment or despair and is not a good interpretation. For a married woman to see as if someone was cutting her nails, because the vision then can express weakness or weakness. Long nails in a man’s dreamAlthough they are disliked in waking life, long nails in a man’s dream are among the positive symbols, because they are a sign of victory. And profit on the material and moral levels. Among the things that are praised in interpretation is the use of a file and nail scissors, as these tools may express the means by which the fortuneteller can achieve some of his goals, and perhaps some of the means by which the fortuneteller can achieve some of his goals, and perhaps some of the means of Qiyafa in interpretation express virtues, piety, and purification, such as a comb, scissors, and a razor blade. Long nails are unpleasant in a dream, so if If it is dirty, it is a sign ",
