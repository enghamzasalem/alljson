This vision also indicates exposure to many worldly problems and undertaking adventures that involve Danger and threat to one's future and present. Seeing wine is also a sign of removal from office, loss of position and honor, heavy loss, failure to achieve desired goals, and aggravation of debts and problems. If the dreamer sees water mixed with wine, this indicates that lies are mixed with the truth, it He falls into the machinations of Satan and enters into disputes over fleeting material things that will be of no use on the day of the meeting with God. If someone sees that he is drinking alcohol until he gets drunk, this indicates the prevailing worldly concerns, and humiliating defeats from subsequent and successive disappointments. Seeing and drinking alcohol is an expression of deviation. About the correct approach, violation of instinct and higher laws, and a display of reprehensible morals that are neither acceptable nor accepted. If a person sees that he is drinking alcohol and has not tasted it in his life, then this vision is a warning to him to beware of falling into sin in an hour of negligence or lying due to ignorance and lack of knowledge. But if he is satisfied with drinking alcohol, this indicates the joy of his desires and immersion in the world of sin. "
