Interpretation of a dream about seeing a mouth in a dream for a man From this standpoint, we present to you the most important and prominent interpretations and explanations that have been reported about this vision in a man’s dream, which are as follows: If a man sees a wonderful and beautiful restaurant in his dream, a good smell spreads from that place. Then he goes to this restaurant and orders a lot of cold food, because his mouth will not accept it at all. There is no doubt that this indicates that he took money in an illegal way. It should be noted here that God Almighty helps him get rid of all this, and God Almighty is higher and more knowledgeable. Likewise, if a person sees in his dream that he is eating some sweets, and its taste is delicious and nice, and its smell is also, as his mouth enjoys the food. Certainly, this indicates the abundant good that will come to him by the command of God Almighty. In his youth, if he sees in a dream that his mouth has a lot of sores and pimples, and he cannot eat from it, because it hurts him a lot.
