Interpretation of bees in a dream: It is a blessing and a spoil, and the testimony exaggerated the fulfillment of the intention, and we learned that a man came to the Messenger God, and he said: I saw in a dream an umbrella purifying mistletoe and honey, and people were licking it, so I took a lot of it and was independent. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: O Messenger, let me pass it. It is only the Qur’an, and reading it is a sweetness, and people take it, as it is abundant and independent. It was narrated on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he said: I saw as if I was in an iron dome, and if there was honey from the sky, then the man licked a lick or two, and the man licked it. More than him, and some of them felt. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: Let me convey it, O Messenger of God. The Iron Dome is Islam, or honey descends from the sky, the Qur’an, and as for whoever licks it, he is the one who learns the surah and two surahs, and as for what he feels, they are the ones who collect it. God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: You are right, Abu Bakr. On the authority of Abdullah, he said: O Messenger of God, I saw in a dream that these fingers of mine were dripping butter and dripping honey, and I was licking them. He said to him: You read the two books. And honey for the religious is sweetness and recitation of the Qur’an and good deeds, and for the people of this world is earning spoils without effort, but we said honey in reference to the Qur’an, because God Almighty described both of them as: a cure for reproach from your Lord and a cure for what is in the breasts. Interpretation of bees in a dream by Ibn Sirin. It is said that eating honey It indicates the embrace and kiss of a lover, and whoever eats bread with honey will earn his living from spoils. Whoever dreams that he ate honey, collected it, or brought it, then he will suffer money, spoils, and joy, and if he is a slave, he will be freed, and if he is sick, he will recover. . Perhaps honey indicates the words of justice and seeking the Qur’an and knowledge in a good way, and perhaps it indicates marriage and marriage. Honey is one of the great and favorite things for all of us, and it is important for human health and a cure for many diseases, as it is considered a protector against infection from some diseases, and for this there are explanations and connotations that indicate that. Dreaming of honey means that money and halal money are coming, whether the money comes from inheritance or work, but clerics and jurists have a special interpretation of honey in a dream, which is that it indicates the spread of charity and good behavior among people and the existence of religion and the spread of its teachings, and there is another interpretation. If a person dreams of honey in a dream without making an effort, this means that the person will obtain money without effort or effort through inheritance, but if a person dreams of honey in a dream, but he is tired, this indicates that the person will obtain money, but it will be Through fatigue and effort through his wages at work. There are people who dream of drinking honey in dreams to the point that you feel the sensation of drinking from it, so the interpreters interpreted this as meaning that this person will meet someone dear to his heart, and there are other people who dream of pure honey in a dream, so they interpreted it that.

Interpretation of bees in a dream: It is a blessing and a spoil, and the testimony exaggerated the fulfillment of the intention, and we learned that a man came to the Messenger God, and he said: I saw in a dream an umbrella purifying mistletoe and honey, and people were licking it, so I took a lot of it and was independent. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: O Messenger, let me pass it. It is only the Qur’an, and reading it is a sweetness, and people take it, as it is abundant and independent. It was narrated on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he said: I saw as if I was in an iron dome, and if there was honey from the sky, then the man licked a lick or two, and the man licked it. More than him, and some of them felt. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: Let me convey it, O Messenger of God. The Iron Dome is Islam, or honey descends from the sky, the Qur’an, and as for whoever licks it, he is the one who learns the surah and two surahs, and as for what he feels, they are the ones who collect it. God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: You are right, Abu Bakr. On the authority of Abdullah, he said: O Messenger of God, I saw in a dream that these fingers of mine were dripping butter and dripping honey, and I was licking them. He said to him: You read the two books. And honey for the religious is sweetness and recitation of the Qur’an and good deeds, and for the people of this world is earning spoils without effort, but we said honey in reference to the Qur’an, because God Almighty described both of them as: a cure for reproach from your Lord and a cure for what is in the breasts. Interpretation of bees in a dream by Ibn Sirin. It is said that eating honey It indicates the embrace and kiss of a lover, and whoever eats bread with honey will earn his living from spoils. Whoever dreams that he ate honey, collected it, or brought it, then he will suffer money, spoils, and joy, and if he is a slave, he will be freed, and if he is sick, he will recover. . Perhaps honey indicates the words of justice and seeking the Qur’an and knowledge in a good way, and perhaps it indicates marriage and marriage. Honey is one of the great and favorite things for all of us, and it is important for human health and a cure for many diseases, as it is considered a protector against infection from some diseases, and for this there are explanations and connotations that indicate that. Dreaming of honey means that money and halal money are coming, whether the money comes from inheritance or work, but clerics and jurists have a special interpretation of honey in a dream, which is that it indicates the spread of charity and good behavior among people and the existence of religion and the spread of its teachings, and there is another interpretation. If a person dreams of honey in a dream without making an effort, this means that the person will obtain money without effort or effort through inheritance, but if a person dreams of honey in a dream, but he is tired, this indicates that the person will obtain money, but it will be Through fatigue and effort through his wages in his work. There are people who dream of drinking honey in dreams to the point that you feel the sensation of drinking from it, so the interpreters interpreted this as meaning that this person will meet someone dear to his heart, and there are other people who dream of pure honey in a dream, so they interpreted it that.
