            "html": " Interpretation of seeing a bridge or bridge in a dream: The dreamer may see that he is standing on a bridge in the dream or has succeeded in crossing it, and he may see that he has fallen from above and is in danger of the dream through the following. Interpretation of the dream of a bridge in a dream: Seeing a bridge in a dream contains seven signs: First: It A praiseworthy vision if the dreamer dreams that he is crossing a high bridge, because this symbol indicates many promising changes in his life, and this change can be represented in different forms, including the following: By moving from a simple job to an important professional position, the dreamer may look forward to establishing his company Especially to earn a lot of halal money. Perhaps this change that the person is going through is his transition from a simple residence to a residence more luxurious and luxurious than this. It is possible that this change is related to the emotional side of human life. If the dreamer is married and her married life is not calm in wakefulness Perhaps her dream of crossing a high bridge indicates that her relationship with her husband is free of the temptations and quarrels that filled her, and then she enjoys it. Thus. Second: If a divorced woman dreams that she is crossing a bridge, this is a sign of her success in overcoming her problems related to divorce, which are summed up in her obtaining all her legal and legal rights and that her ex-husband will not be harmed or harmed. That she will want to renew her energy and fill her heart with hope so that she can start a new life free of pain.

Fifth: Seeing the bridge can be interpreted that the dreamer will gain a lot of knowledge soon, and this also indicates academic success at all educational levels.

Of the torment that some people will face in the afterlife as a result of neglecting their religion, the symbol of the bridge indicates that the dreamer will live happily with God. It will give him a life free of problems and stress. Seven: If the dreamer sees in his dream that the bridge was built from solid stones and suddenly sees that it was built with the ground (meaning that the building materials with which it was built were made from stones in the ground), then this bad dream is interpreted. That the dreamer will change his circumstances from better to worse. If he was rich, he would suffer from drought and debt, and if he was happy in life, he would find misfortune to accompany him. But if the opposite happened and the dreamer saw in his dream that the bridge built with earth had become solid and built with stones, then this scene will be interpreted. Contrary to the bad symbols previously mentioned. It is known that dreams differ from wakefulness and that many things happen in them that we do not see in reality...human to inanimate objects and this symbol has many meanings in interpretation. Then if the dreamer sees that he turned around and became a bridge in the dream and everyone crossed it, This is p ",
