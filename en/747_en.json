Interpretation of the living person’s performance on dead coins. The jurists explained that if the dead person takes money, clothes, or food from the dreamer, the dream has two interpretations: The first explanation: The dead person’s need for charity and his desire to increase his good deeds; Because he needs someone to pray over him and remind him of righteousness so that God will remove his pain and torment from him. The second interpretation: The dreamer may lose a lot of money and may live sad in the next few days due to the death of a family member.

Increase these alms and multiply them because the dead person needs them, and wants to increase his good deeds in order to enjoy a measure of Paradise. When the dreamer sees that he gave coins to the dead, and after a short period in the dream the dreamer finds a treasure full of money, then the dream indicates an increase in money and an increase in his livelihood in this world because of his charity. On the soul of the dead in reality. Interpretation of the performance of the living on the dead coins for single people.
