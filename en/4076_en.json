Interpretation of dreams Daydreams are a type of dream that a person engages in during the day and takes the form of an imaginary mental activity and its causes may be due to mental, psychological, emotional or social motives and helps to achieve balance. Most of those who use this method are teenagers to express themselves and their tendencies. It is usually for short intermittent periods, but it may extend to the point of absorption. It can develop into a pathological condition, which is a condition in which a person cannot distinguish between reality and dreams due to the intensity of his immersion in it and the length of its periods. The main reason for daydreams is the inability to face reality. Because of the feeling of deficiency or inferiority, it is a way for a person to escape from his reality and resort to a beautiful world that he designs in his imagination, and this imaginary or virtual world is the ideal place that a person wants to be. In. He escapes the problems and defects of his reality and lives the life he desires. As if he were weak and frail. He lives in a world in which he is a ruler with great power or is poor. He creates a world in which he is rich and powerful or is associated with a person he cannot reach. He lives in a world with this person and they live with the best minds. Daydreaming is like other psychological matters. It has positive and negative aspects. Its positive elements are in developing a person's thinking and imagination. Creating a virtual world can help solve the problems a person faces and enhance his personality. Moving away from the bitter reality of a person leads to improving a person's psyche and achieving psychological balance. As for the negatives. It constantly leads to loss of focus and lack of interest. When a man is somewhere else and does not pay attention to what is going on around him, this is a manifestation of personal weakness and lack of self-confidence and makes the man a loser. He does not face his problems or his reality, but uses the fastest way, which is escape. Balance is what makes a person stable. It pushes him forward in all aspects of his life. Daydreaming, like other things, needs balance to prevent it from turning into a mental illness. It can destroy his present and future. Excessive dreams of this type can make a person unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy. Which causes him serious psychological problems and defects. Therefore; Several factors must be taken into account when daydreaming. Among them is that the periods should be short and during periods of relaxation so that the person does not do it while working or when doing something important. He should not do it while he is nervous or psychologically exhausted, because this will prolong the dream period and negatively affect his psyche when he returns to reality. It should not be a habit or approach that a person follows at all times because over time it will become obligatory and will negatively affect him. "
