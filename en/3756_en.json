            "html": " Interpretation of seeing a tailor in a dream: Seeing a tailor in a dream does not always bring good or always bad, but its interpretation varies according to the vision and according to who saw the vision, if the dreamer is single or married, or if she is a single girl, pregnant, or married woman, and each of them has good and evil, and it is known Seeing a tailor in a dream is one of the visions that all of these groups can see. Sewing in a dream When a married woman sees a tailor in a dream, this is evidence that she is living a happy life full of tranquility, kindness, and joy, and evidence of the abundance of this woman’s livelihood and that her home is full of blessing and love, which is happiness. . From her husband’s respect for her and her carrying out his religious duties with her and her children. Seeing a married woman sewing and holding the thread is a vision that shows her husband and according to the tailor’s facial expressions in the dream, the interpretation is, and also seeing a needle indicates his married daughter. Seeing a married woman sewing torn and scattered socks is evidence of Change for the better, and that the married woman is trying hard to protect her home and family from fragmentation and fragmentation, and she must be honest with her husband to help her preserve the family. When a pregnant woman sees sewing in a dream, this is evidence of the stress of labor and that she may give birth by cesarean section and face some troubles, but she can overcome On her and that her child will be healthy. The tailor in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin was interested in interpreting the symbol of the tailor in the dream, and we will divide these interpretations into two halves. The first half in this we will talk about the praiseworthy performances. The other half in which we will mention the undesirable interpretations: The praiseworthy interpretations include three points and they are as follows. First: The traveler will return to his family. It is worth noting that the translation means all travelers and not a specific person, that is, the traveling husband will return to his wife, the immigrant son will return to his family, and every person who was deported from his family, either due to strife or severing family ties, will return to his rights and know that what he did before It was a mistake and then returns to them when the relationship reaches its peak, so Ibn Sirin agrees with Al. - Al-Nabulsi in this interpretation. Second: Ibn Sirin’s vision of the tailor suggests a connotation opposite to the previous one, which is that there is an opportunity to travel waiting for the dreamer soon. Third: Ibn Sirin said that if the dreamer uses thread and a needle to sew other people’s clothes, the scene will be interpreted as a dreamer and a preacher in The vigil and provides people with a lot of advice to change their lives for the better. Second: Undesirable interpretations include two points: First: If the husband sews clothes for his wife in his dream and in the vision separates them with his hand without the help of a tailor, then the scene is bad and speaks of a major disaster that will occur in him.
