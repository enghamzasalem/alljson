            "text": "Praying for marriage to a specific person in the rain in a dream is one of the promising things that make the dreamer more optimistic and anticipating the coming events, but what about the signs related to seeing a plea for marriage to a specific person, and interpretations vary depending on the dreamer's marital status? This is what we will discover in detail by searching for the opinions of the great commentators on our website.\n\nMost interpreters have stated that seeing rain in a dream is a praiseworthy sign of abundance of sustenance, multiple blessings, and good fortune in the dreamer's life, and praying in the rain proves his closeness to God Almighty and his steadfastness. The desire to be content with piety and righteous deeds, and the dream generally indicates the good state of his circumstances and the existence of a stable atmosphere between the dreamer and his family members, which puts him in a good psychological state.\n\nSeeing the request in dreams is one of the dreams that promise good news for the dreamer, according to his marital status, whether he is single or married, as it indicates that he will achieve what he wants in life from his goals and aspirations. And the plea for marriage and the utterance of the name of the desired one are among the promising signs of marrying that very person in real life, and God knows best.\n\nIbn Sirin explained many good signs, and they are seeing prayer in the rain in a dream, and if the prayer is for marriage to a specific person, then this indicates the good fortune of the seer and his success in choosing a life partner, and therefore his emotional and emotional life with his family will be filled with love and harmony because there is great harmony and appreciation between them. The dream is also a good omen for the seer that he is about to achieve the hopes and aspirations he has been striving for for a long time and thought were difficult to achieve.\n\nThe interpretation of prayer for marriage in the rain is not limited only to the dreamer's approaching marriage, but is sometimes related to the coming of happy events and pleasant circumstances, and the person reaching a high position in his work, and therefore he gets the material and moral appreciation that he aspires to, as many experts have mentioned that praying in the rain is an answer that is close to all the prayers and dreams of all people.\n\nIbn Shaheen said that praying for marriage in the rain is like relief from worries and pains, and the justice of the seer's circumstances, and providing for what he wants and aspires to.  He is ready to implement with God's permission. As for the loud voice of an unmarried young man or girl praying for marriage to a specific person, it is considered an ill omen for falling into a fabricated conspiracy or meeting a bad-mannered person who can deceive the seer with his falsehood. But in reality, he has malicious intentions, so he must be careful and avoid dealing with him so as not to hate him.\n\nImam al-Sadiq mentioned many and diverse interpretations of seeing a plea in the rain for marriage, and he found that it relates to many matters of life that are not limited to marriage. If the dreamer is suffering from a chronic disease or a serious health problem at the present time, and he sees that he is praying to God in a dream inside the mosque, this leads to a speedy recovery and healing from all his illnesses by the will of God.  As for those who suffer from poor financial conditions or many problems and conflicts in their lives, the dream conveys to them good news of the easing of their affairs and the correction of their situation, with the end of the obstacles and difficulties that bother him and prevent him from achieving his ambitions.  He will also be very successful in his emotional life, making him happy and stable.\n\nIf an unmarried girl sees in her dream that she is praying to God Almighty to marry a specific person she knows in reality and has feelings of love for and wants to be her life partner, but there are many obstacles preventing her from marrying, then the dream in reality reflects what occupies her mind and controls her life.  She is thinking about this matter, and therefore she is asking God Almighty to ease matters and correct their affairs so that they will eventually get what they want.\n\nBut if the girl is in the school stage and has no inclination to fall into the trap of this period, then the dream promises you news of success and excellence in her studies and obtaining the qualifications she wants. She will also enter the job she dreams of, which will provide her with all her needs and bring her closer to her dreams.  As for the close one who is pleading with crying and supplication, it is a sign of relief from distress and the cessation of seizures, but seeing screaming and raising one's voice leads to suffering great shocks in life.\n\nSeeing an unmarried woman praying in her dream with her hands raised is interpreted as a good sign that her circumstances have changed for the better.  It is one of the good visions that carry beautiful meanings and symbols for the end of the period of distress and confusion she is going through, and the dreams and hope she wishes to be close to her, and therefore a new stage will begin saturated with stability and psychological peace.  Praying to the Lord Almighty with dignity and urgency indicates that the girl will persevere in doing good deeds and lend a helping hand to help the poor and needy.  And she will find a job that suits her skills, so that she will gain the promotions and material and moral considerations she deserves, and she will marry a righteous young man who always takes care of her comfort and happiness, and God knows best.\n\nIf a married woman sees that she is praying to God Almighty to marry her husband again, then this is a sign of her love for him and her desire to stay by his side all the time. It is also a sign of her longing and desire to become a mother, and she pleads with the Almighty God in reality and the world of dreams, and He responds to her and blesses her with righteous offspring.\n\nThere are many opinions about a pregnant woman asking to be married again in the rain. The dream is a good omen for her health and psychological state, and peace and reassurance descends upon her from God Almighty, so she gets rid of negative thoughts.  Obsessions and she is assured of the fetus's health. \n"
