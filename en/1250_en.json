They circumambulate the Kaaba and there is a Surah from the Holy Qur’an called “Hajj”. After that, we will explain to you what is the interpretation of the dream of Hajj in a dream according to what was narrated by the great scholar Muhammad bin Sirin in his book Interpretation of Dreams. Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and God has made it obligatory for those Muslims who are able, and it includes certain pillars that the servant must perform in order to please God.

If an unmarried woman advances to an age without marriage and sees in a dream that she is climbing Mount Arafat, this means that her marriage is approaching and may indicate the fulfillment of desires and God Almighty’s response to her supplication. If an unmarried girl dreams that she is performing the Hajj, this is a good vision that portends With her marriage soon or the approaching date of her engagement. Seeing the Kaaba in the dream of an unmarried girl is one of the praiseworthy and noble visions that predicts her marriage to a man with many beautiful qualities such as honesty and generosity.
