            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about loss There is no doubt that the feeling of loss is one of the most difficult feelings that a person can go through in his life, and if a person dreams of being lost, he quickly asks about the different meanings and meanings associated with this dream and whether it brings him. Good for him or not, and we will explain this in some detail in the following lines of the article. Interpretation of the dream of loss There are many interpretations mentioned by scholars in seeing loss in a dream, and the most important of them can be explained through the following: Imam Al-Nabulsi - may God have mercy on him - says that seeing the lost in a dream is a sign of the state of anxiety and confusion that prevails in the dreamer during this period of his life. The dream of confusion may symbolize that the dreamer is a negligent person who wastes his time on useless things that will not bring him any benefit at all. If you dream that you are lost and wandering the streets aimlessly, this means that your mind is occupied these days with something that makes you feel confused. If the person is a seeker of knowledge in reality and sees the loss in his dream, this is an indication that he will be able to benefit people from his knowledge one day and have a high position in society. Interpretation of the dream of loss by Ibn Sirin The great scholar Muhammad bin Sirin - may God have mercy on him - explained the following in his interpretation of the dream of the lost: Seeing a lost person in a dream symbolizes that the dreamer has no ambitions or goals that he seeks to achieve and that he has no passion for life. If someone sees in a dream that he is lost In the desert and looking for a place to find shelter for comfort, this will lead him to face some difficulties and obstacles in his life that prevent him from reaching what he wants. When a person dreams that he is lost in a strange place and finds inside it poisonous insects, reptiles and spiders, this is a sign that he will face great danger or harm in the coming period and will suffer harm.
