Many of us see in a dream that he is calling upon God Almighty, and these visions stem from a real and urgent desire to achieve things in real life, but there are different interpretations to interpret the dream of begging. These interpretations stop at The vision itself and the condition of the dreamer, and through the following lines in the encyclopedia, we will provide many different interpretations of the dream of begging. Begging. Interpretation of supplication in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin says that seeing supplication in a dream is evidence of the dreamer’s closeness to God Almighty, His justice, and His guidance. Supplication also indicates the dreamer’s desire to satisfy certain desires that occupy his mind as he questions the answer to his supplication. And if someone sees that he is supplicating to God and that his relationship God is strong, this is evidence of God’s response to this supplication, and supplication in a dream after the end of prayer means the end of psychological, familial and emotional problems. If the debtor sees that he is begging, this is good news that he will pay his debts. And whoever sees that he is traveling and praying, this indicates his return to his homeland or receiving someone who will comfort him in his exile, and praying for the prisoner in a dream is evidence that the end of his imprisonment is near. While screaming and crying during prayer is evidence that the dreamer has gone through problems and difficulties. As for supplication without mentioning the name of God, it is evidence of the dreamer’s hypocrisy in some of his religious deeds, such as prayer and charity. Praying for oneself is a denial of God’s blessings and despair of His mercy. The oppressed person who prays for someone who wronged him in his dream is that His prayer is heard. Interpretation of supplication in a dream by Al-Nabulsi. Al-Nabulsi sees the dreamer’s vision of crying out to God as evidence of his relief from his distress and salvation from his worries and problems. If he sees himself crying while on the phone, this indicates the presence of difficulties and problems in his life. And whoever sees that he wants to pray and does not He knows how, as it is a warning to him of his distance from God Almighty. Interpretation of supplication in a dream by Ibn Shaheen Ibn Shaheen says: A man begging for himself in a dream is good news about the provision of a righteous child, and if he asks for mercy for himself, this indicates a good ending, and the satisfaction of his need. As for seeing a soul The person calls on another person and not God, then this is evidence that he is afraid of that person and is trying to get close to him. Seeing a supplication for the oppressor means that the dreamer supports this person and helps him in his evil work. But if he makes a plea to a familiar person, this indicates that the dreamer will continue to perform his duties. Interpretation of a dream of a single woman praying: If a girl sees that she is praying after completing her prayer, this means that she is good and evidence of her good reputation and that her problems are over. As for the woman’s silent crying during prayer, it is evidence of its response, as crying is a relief, and the vision of praying for a righteous husband indicates that her engagement is approaching. Sincerely.Interpretation of a dream about a married woman praying: Seeing a married woman praying in a dream is evidence that a lot of good is coming to her and her husband, but if she is praying in the rain, this is good news that her husband will be promoted, and her prayer for her children means achieving what she desires, so if she is concerned, God will ease her worry.Interpretation of a dream about prayer Pregnant woman: If a pregnant woman sees that she is begging God ",
