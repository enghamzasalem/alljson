            "text": " Interpretation of prison in a dream by Imam Al-Sadiq and the most famous scholars of interpretation, you will find it in this article on the Encyclopedia website, as prison is considered one of the most desolate and frightening places for many, and it has different concepts, until you find the oppressor and the oppressed in it, and the interpretation of visions differs according to the nature of the dreamer, gender, psychological, material and social status and his relationship with those around him, the interpretation of a dream for an unmarried woman differs from its interpretation for a married woman or a man, but all these opinions are personal judgments of scholars only, and all destinies are in the hands of God and He alone knows the unseen, and the prison can appear in a dream as an isolated and dark place, or in the form of high walls, or any of the other signs that indicate distress and suffocation. Interpretation of prison in a dream by Imam Al-SadiqImam Al-Sadiq believes that the interpretation of seeing prison in a dream differs according to the dreamer's condition and his social, psychological and economic status and his relationship with those around him. Sometimes, prison symbolizes a positive attitude and an abundance of sustenance that fills the dreamer's life and can indicate injustice, corruption and anxiety, depending on the dreamer's psychological state. Chains and chains in dreams indicate worries Debts and severe sadness, if these restrictions are severe, this means that the dreamer is going through major psychological and material crises and it is difficult for him to overcome them easily. If the dreamer is able to escape from prison and remove the shackles from his hand, this means that he will be able to overcome the crises, God willing, and he will be able to take advantage of the opportunities available to him. Fears and psychological problems can be interpreted by the subconscious mind in a dream in the form of imprisonment or imprisonment. If the dreamer is in debt and has many material worries, and he sees in a dream that he breaks the shackles and handcuffs from his hand, this means that he will be able to overcome these crises. Interpretation of prison in a dream by Ibn Sirin The scholar Ibn Sirin believes that imprisonment in a dream often reflects the crises and problems that the dreamer is going through in real life. If the dreamer is able to get out of prison and free himself from the restrictions, this means that he is able to manage his affairs wisely and conscientiously, and it means that, God willing, he will find solutions to his problems in the near future. If the dreamer in a dream enjoys great freedom after captivity and imprisonment, this means that he will soon recover, God willing, if he is suffering from an illness or one of his relatives will be cured if he is suffering from an illness. Freedom after captivity in a dream symbolizes comfort and goodness after hardships, difficulties and problems. Feeling injustice and oppression symbolizes that there are many conspiracies and negative thoughts surrounding the dreamer from those close to him and he must be careful and not trust everyone, because problems may come to him from where he does not know. If the dreamer enters prison and cannot escape and the prison continues to imprison him, this indicates his many mistakes and his need to repent and return to God and not oppress any soul. If the prison door is open and the dreamer can escape at any time, this means that great positive changes will occur in his life and he must "
