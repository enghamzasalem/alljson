And whoever sees milk on his chest, if he is poor, he will be rich and old, and he will have two children, and if he is not married, then this indicates the birth of a child. If a young woman sees it, it means that she is pregnant, and I am pregnant for her.

Interpretation of breast milk in a dream. The secretion of milk from the breast of a pregnant woman is evidence that the child will please his parents and bring them many blessings. The unmarried woman who sees a bare breast in a dream is an indication of her imminent marriage. Also, seeing a girl exposing her breasts to a stranger or in front of her family is an indication of her imminent marriage. If the girl sees that her breasts contain milk, then this indicates that she will marry a decent man who is ready for marriage. If the unmarried woman sees blood coming out of her chest, then this means that she will marry someone who is not suitable for marriage, or that one of her relatives is actually dying. Seeing the breasts in a dream means the father and mother. Seeing an unmarried woman with three breasts in a dream is evidence of anxiety and sadness. People who look at the girl's chest in a dream are evidence of a scandal that she may find and that she is walking the forbidden path. If the girl sees that something disgusting is coming out of one of her breasts, then this is evidence of the death of one of her parents. Seeing a married woman exposing her breast to her husband is evidence of marital happiness. Seeing a married woman whose breasts are larger than real is evidence of marital happiness. A married woman exposing her breasts to a stranger is evidence of deception. If the married woman sees that her breasts contain milk or water, then this is evidence of an impending pregnancy or the acquisition of a lot of money. Seeing the breast larger than reality is evidence of happiness. Cutting off the breast of a married woman is evidence of the death of one of her daughters. Seeing a married woman having three breasts is evidence that one of her daughters will give birth to her. Binding the woman's breast and hanging from one of them is evidence of adultery or many sins. Seeing a married woman with something disgusting coming out of her chest is evidence of her husband's journey, death, or divorce.

The blood that comes out of the breast of a pregnant woman indicates the child's disrespect for his parents or that he will get sick. A pregnant woman who sees her breasts beautiful and large is evidence of a happy life. A pregnant woman who sees her breasts small and unattractive is evidence of her suffering after childbirth.
