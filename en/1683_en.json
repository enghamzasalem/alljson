Interpretation of a camera in a dream If you dream of a camera, a camera, this means that changes will happen to you and you will find yourself in an inappropriate environment and you will be surrounded by deceitful people. And if a girl dreams that she is taking pictures with a camera, this predicts that Her current future will bring with her a lot of unhappiness and that her boyfriend will expose her to serious disappointment.
