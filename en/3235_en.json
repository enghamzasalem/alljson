Some people see in their dream that they are wearing a watch, buying it, or looking at it to see the time, but they do not know what that means, as the topic seems ambiguous in this type of dream, which prompts us to search for its meaning. The most important question remains, does seeing a watch in a dream mean good news? Will it happen to the owner of the vision that portends something bad? We will know this through an encyclopedia that presents to you the interpretation of this dream for men and its meaning for unmarried and pregnant women. Interpretation of the clock in a dream by Ibn SirinIbn Sirin gave different interpretations of this dream in the following cases: Whoever sees the clock in his dream and hears the sound of its ticking, this indicates something that the dreamer hates, and the dreamer represents it by hearing Sad bread soon, and God knows best. According to Ibn Sirin’s interpretation, seeing a clock is one of the unpleasant visions for the dreamer, especially in the case of seeing a wall clock, and this indicates that the dreamer is suffering from many problems in his real life. Whoever sees in his dream that he is getting rid of the wall clock, this symbolizes the end of His troubles and the end of his worries and problems in reality.
