It is a reptile that lives in deserts and farms as well as in homes. And it can change its color to hide from those who want to kill them, so in this article today we will learn together about the interpretation of seeing the killing of a goose in a dream according to the interpretation of Ibn Shaheen, Ibn Sirin and Imam Al-Sadiq.

The dreamer who raises a gecko in his house in a dream shows the difficulty and misery of his children in raising and evaluating them. As for the visionary who cooks a cart in his dream, it indicates that he is trying to achieve something he desires but fails to do it, and it also indicates the dreamer’s illness. Ibn Sirin says that the harvest in the house is a devil because it was blowing fire on our master Ibrahim, peace be upon him, or driving him crazy because of the lightness and speed of its movements. A gecko in a dream symbolizes magic and envy, and all its types are poisonous and it takes a lot of effort to kill it and inflict Defeat him.

The bellies of the house symbolize the suffering of the people of this house of envy for all the good blessings that God has bestowed upon them. The gecko’s attempt to reach the dreamer’s house indicates that the dreamer befriends people who are not fair and hypocrites who conspire against him. Killing the dreamer to help him in a dream indicates the great good that will come to him in the next life, and will alleviate his worries and remove his distress. Interpretation of a dream about seeing a gecko in a dream for a single woman, interpretation of Ibn Sirin. According to what Ibn Sirin said about seeing the belly of a single woman in her sleep, we have revealed the following: Seeing a gecko in a dream indicates that there are bad people in her life who talk badly about her and wish her harm. The single woman who sees a gecko running in her dream indicates She enters into an emotional relationship that has no interest and it is better to stop it.

Oh God, make his illness an atonement for all his sins. And make the last martyrdom the martyrdom of the world. Oh God, confirm this with steadfast speech, raise his rank, forgive his sins, and balance his scales. Oh God, consider it a mere calculation, for He is more merciful than His servants and more merciful than a mother with her child. Oh God, deprive him of his flesh, blood, and skin in Hell. Oh God, open the doors of your paradise and the doors of your mercy, O God. Oh God, forgive him until there is no forgiveness left. Oh God, please "
