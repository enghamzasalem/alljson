            "html": " A black beetle in a dream and the consequences of seeing it. Seeing a black beetle in a dream has many meanings and meanings that are sometimes good news and other times a bad omen for the dreamer. The beetle is an insect with a disgusting appearance that is feared by young and old alike. Seeing it in a dream is something pleasant for the human soul. The black beetle in a dream is beyond Beetles are one of the many types of insects that are found in their wake. Ibn Sirin gave many explanations about insects in general and said the following: Envy is the first indicator of insects of all kinds, and therefore we have to give many detailed explanations of the meaning of envy, as it is one of the hated things. On the religious and humanitarian level. In her marriage, life is filled with true unfortunate stories that were caused by envy. Therefore, if the dreamer dreams of a beetle, he must know the seriousness of the situation in which he will live, but there is no problem in religion that cannot be solved, and the strongest solution to envy is prayer and persistence in supplications and remembrances. Without getting bored. And listen to the Qur’an a lot until the dreamer completely destroys this envy. Perhaps a person dreams of this vision and interprets it with the same interpretations that Ibn Sirin gave for a single woman. Envy may appear in the life of a married woman who saw a beetle in her dream in more than one way. She may feel apathetic at home, especially in her relationship with her partner. She or one of her children may be exposed to a health problem, knowing that this distress may be strong and need time to get rid of it, and they may be jealous of him, and the married dreamer is in business, his health, and his children. His money. Ibn Sirin reassured the dreamers and said that the dreamer’s success in getting rid of the insect (beetle) and escaping from it in the vision will be interpreted as salvation, knowing that the aspects of assistance that the dreamer will enjoy in wakefulness will be many, the most important of which is: The first person: may be saved from an accident. Or a relationship with a malicious person whose goal is to harm him, either by deceiving him or by fabricating a charge against him. This relationship may be for the purpose of exploiting him financially or morally, and God will save him from all these dangers. The second aspect: A married woman can be saved from many debts or from an illness that almost made her sick. Weak and powerless for periods of time. The interpretation of seeing insects or beetles can depend on the damage caused by them, so whenever the dreamer is harmed, it will be interpreted as problems. He decided to erase her from his personality and life forever. Among these features are the following. The first feature: Perhaps the trait of fear controlled him. Fear and success will never meet. The greater the fear, the lower the person’s rate of risk and experience. Half of the success always comes from taking risks and the other half will be an effort that has reached the intended degree of excellence.

            "text": " The beetle in a dream and the consequences of seeing it Seeing a black beetle in a dream has many meanings and meanings that are sometimes good news and other times a bad omen for the dreamer, and the beetle is one of the insects with a disgusting shape that is feared by young and old alike, seeing it in a dream is something pleasant for the human soul. The black beetle in a dream Beetles are one of the many types of insects that have been present in their wake, and Ibn Sirin has given many interpretations of insects in general and said the following: Envy is the first indication of insects of different types, and therefore we have to give many detailed explanations of the meaning of envy, as it is one of the things hated on the religious and human level. In her marriage, life is filled with unfortunate true stories in which envy was the cause. Therefore, if the dreamer dreams of a beetle, he must know the seriousness of the situation in which he will live, but there is no problem in religion, there is no solution to it, and the strongest solution to envy is prayer and insistence in remembrance and remembrance. Without boredom. And listen to the Qur’an a lot until the seer completely destroys this envy, and perhaps a person dreams of this vision and makes it interpreted with the same interpretations that Ibn Sirin put for single women. Envy may appear in the life of a married woman who saw a beetle in her dream in more than one way. She may feel indifference at home, especially in her relationship with her partner. She or one of her children may be exposed to a health problem, knowing that this distress may be strong and needs time to get rid of it, and they may be jealous of him, and the married dreamer in business, his health, and his children. His money. Ibn Sirin reassured the dreamers and said that the dreamer's success in getting rid of the insect (beetle) and escaping from it in the vision will be interpreted as salvation, knowing that the aspects of help that the dreamer will enjoy in wakefulness will be many, the most important of which are; The first person: He may be saved from an accident or a relationship with a malicious person whose goal is to harm him either by deceiving him or by fabricating an accusation against him, and this relationship may be for the purpose of exploiting him materially or morally, and God saves him from all these dangers. The second aspect: A married woman can be saved from many debts or from a disease that almost made her weak and powerless for periods of time. The interpretation of seeing insects or beetles can depend on the harm resulting from them, so whenever the dreamer is harmed, it will be interpreted as problems. He decided to erase them from his personality and life forever. Among these features are the following. The first feature: Perhaps the trait of fear controlled him, and fear and success will never come together, and the more fear increases, the lower the person’s risk and experience rate, and half of success always comes from risk and the other half will be an effort to reach the intended degree of distinction and excellence, and thus he noticed that fear made him confine himself within the walls of his home and caused his inability, so he decided to extinguish it and be brave, The second feature: It is despair, as many young men and women break down due to early despair, or in other words, a person fails to do something once or twice and despairs and leaves it, and this feature is ugly "
