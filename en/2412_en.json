            "html": " Interpretation of walking in a dream Walking in a dream is one of the things that some people think that there is no explanation for or that it represents a random matter that does not symbolize anything, and therefore they are careful in all their movements, and perhaps walking in a dream is among the visions that talk and search for its meaning, so what is better. An interpretation of this vision? Walking in graves in a dream Walking in or between graves symbolizes four signs that can be listed as follows: The first sign: The viewer walks in more than one way without having planned in advance or without knowing where they are going and what the goal of the walk is. He faces life with all his might. He runs here and there and puts his life in danger. He can interfere in matters that mean nothing to him. He does many things at once and randomly and remains like this. I do not know the reason behind all of that. These. The result is a lack of responsibility and the desire to do what he wants, even if it is at the expense of the freedom and interests of others. The second sign was that life had deceived him with its pleasures, so he drowned in it and tasted all kinds of forbidden things. He no longer cared about the consequences of his actions, and he did not want to repent even if he faced His death in this case. He is walking into the unknown, and his present is darker than his many sins, which have led to a hardening of the heart and looking at the world as the only pleasure that a person can enjoy. Also, walking on graves indicates satisfying the needs of the body and neglecting the demands of the soul. The third sign and this significance It is more related to the psychological aspect, as the viewer is exposed to attacks of sadness and anxiety that can lead to suffocation, as he walks alone without company or the presence of people close to him who talk and listen to him, which makes him tend. Being close to accompanying any person, even if it is his death. This is accompanied by a miserable failure in studies or work and the loss of opportunities that would have been better exploited. The fourth sign is the inability to understand what is happening to him and what is the cause of the problems he faces and the worries that surround him from all sides. The fortuneteller gets lost in life and is exposed to all kinds of difficulties and psychological destruction. The solution to all of this is simply to return to God, ask for forgiveness from Him, and start over after getting rid of those who were the reason for increasing his corrupt practices and his many sins. Interpretation of seeing walking in a dream by Ibn Sirin This vision has more than Interpretation, which is as follows: Walking can be the goal of seeking sustenance and legitimate profit and reaching the desired goal after careful preparation and a clear vision for the future. Ibn Sirin went on to say that walking symbolizes the end of worries and the removal of problems and obstacles that prevent a person from achieving his dream, one day. Either from a lot of work and stress, or from studying and seeking knowledge. Walking is the best of religion, moving towards obedience to God, getting closer to Him and His burdens, and crushing the soul’s desires by eating and drinking. And if he sees that he is walking on a path that he believes he knows, this indicates that he will reach The goal that he was always planning and hoping to achieve. And if he walks on an empty path and has no voice, this is a sign that he is walking in search of what God has forbidden, ",
