Molars are the people of the house of the farthest men, or those who adorn themselves with them, or boys who do not reach a degree, so what is above what is after the eye is men, and what is less than what is next to the beard is from women. Whoever sees in one of them an increase, and the advantage of strength, or whiteness, and beauty, then he sees what that tooth enjoys of pleasure, and whoever sees that his tooth has come out of it, he has died, and it is said that he has a debt to God Almighty, or that he has a trust to pay to its owner, or that he will cut off the womb of the one to whom the molar is attributed. Whoever sees that one of his molars or one of his teeth is hurting him, then he hears bad things from his relatives attributed to that molar, or tightens it with his pains. Removing the molar in a dream indicates a long life without his peers. If he sees that all his teeth have fallen out, he will live long.
