What is the interpretation of a dream about a gold ring? The gold ring in a dream carries many meanings. If the dreamer sees it and is happy, it expresses comfort and satisfaction, and if he takes it from his hand, this is a sign of escaping from the anxiety and pain that controls him. Swallowing it in a dream is clear evidence of the greed that distinguishes the dreamer, who must stay away from his possessions permanently, and in this bad way. Removing it is an expression of distancing from friends and not getting close to them, or perhaps if the dreamer is attached, this leads to the final termination of this relationship. If it is black, this indicates the distress he is exposed to in his life because he is exposed to bad things that bother him at every moment through a person he trusts and does not deserve that Trust. As for the white color, it is evidence of the amount of goodness inside the dreamer and that he achieves his goals with his good treatment and kindness to others, so his financial condition is at its best and he does not live in material injustice, whatever it is.

If the ring gets stuck in his throat without him being able to swallow it, this means that he is in a crisis that weakens him and he cannot reveal it to anyone, so he does not reveal it or hide it in himself. It causes him great sadness and mental fatigue. Seeing him as an older person does not express malice, but rather indicates the loyal people present in the dreamer's life. This friendship again cannot be replaced, so no matter what happens, he must not lose it.
