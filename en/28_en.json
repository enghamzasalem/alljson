It indicates the emergence of happiness, joy, and pleasure in her life, as the vision indicates the emergence of new things in the life of the unmarried girl that make her happier and more comfortable. The vision also indicates that she has gotten rid of hypocrites, bad events, and missed opportunities that she regretted in the past, as she has gotten rid of difficulties and obstacles, and she has gotten rid of the worries and sorrows she faces and turned her life for the better to a great extent.\n\n**Interpretation of the Way of Hair Removal for Unmarried Women by Ibn Sirin:**\n\nIbn Sirin gives many interpretations of this vision, some of them good news and some bad. Ibn Sirin believes that seeing an unmarried girl in a dream removing her pubic hair means that her marriage will come soon to a suitable person with a mature mind. But if the unmarried girl sees that she is asking for help from a relative or friend to remove it, this indicates that person's love for her, his affection for her, her strong trust in him, and her great dependence on him. \n\nOn the other hand, the vision may indicate a material disaster for the unmarried girl who sees this dream, if she is wealthy. The vision also warns of sad events such as the loss and death of a loved one, if she is seen removing these hairs outside her house, such as removing them at a beauty salon or otherwise.\n\n**Dream Interpretation of Cutting Pubic Hair for an Unmarried Woman:**\n\nSeeing a single girl cut the hair of her genital area indicates the arrival of kindness, the arrival of happiness, the ease of achieving her goals, and the elimination of major obstacles that prevented her from feeling contentment and happiness. It indicates the end of a long period of sadness and the beginning of a new happy period.\n\n**Dream Interpretation of Pubic Hair Removal for Unmarried Women:**\n\nSome interpreters attribute the interpretation of the dream of hair removal to the feeling of pain or not, and to the removal of all the hair or part of it. Feeling pain while removing pubic hair indicates the occurrence of certain problems and crises in the girl's life, which she may suffer from a lot, but she will soon be able to overcome them. But if she sees that she removes the pubic hair without pain, this indicates the achievement of goals and the ease of achieving her goals and what she hopes to achieve.\n\nSimilarly, seeing some hair being removed and leaving the rest is an indication of a problem or receiving bad news and events that upset her. always aspire to.\n\nIf the girl sees herself using someone she knows to remove this hair, some commentators have confirmed that this vision has two conflicting meanings. The first is the girl's trust in this person and her love for him, and the second is the complete lack of self-reliance for the girl.\n\n**Dream Interpretation of Hair Removal from Sensitive Areas for Unmarried Women:**\n\nSeeing the removal of hair from the genital area in the dream of an unmarried girl is a reflection of her great fear of some things in her life and thinking about them to a great extent. It also reflects her great fear of the future and what is to come. If the vision is accompanied by the girl's feeling of joy and happiness after removing the hair, this is a sign that a new opportunity will be available to her and will be exploited well, and this opportunity will compensate her for a missed opportunity in the past and did not exploit it yet.\n\nAlso, seeing going to a beauty salon to remove pubic hair or sensitive area hair indicates unpleasant events and news. It was said that a close person died for the unmarried girl who sees this dream or this vision. \n\n**Dream Interpretation of Plucking Pubic Hair for an Unmarried Woman:**\n\nMost of the time, and for most interpreters and jurists, seeing pubic hair removal in the dream of a single girl is a double-edged sword. The interpretation face is more optimistic than improving her life and changing it for the better. The vision at that time is a sign that she will be sad and that she will find herself in a health or financial crisis or in a major social problem.\n\nIbn Sirin also believed that seeing an unmarried girl removing her pubic hair is one of the visions that bode well and indicates the achievement of goals and the fulfillment of desires and aspirations that she aspires to.\n\n**Dream Interpretation of Hair Removal from the Arms for an Unmarried Woman:**\n\nRemoving arm hair is one of the visions that carries many connotations and indications for the unmarried girl, as the vision indicates that she has gone through a difficult period and was able to break free from some restrictions that prevented her from achieving her dreams and great aspirations.\n\nHowever, the vision may reflect some negative traits in the girl's character, such as her inability to make the right decisions, recklessness in certain behaviors, and her inability to solve her problems wisely, which leads to the exacerbation of problems and the increase of difficulties she goes through.\n\n**Dream Interpretation of Armpit Hair Removal for Single Women:**\n\nIbn Sirin links the interpretation of seeing armpit hair removal to the feeling of pain, as he confirmed that seeing armpit hair removal without feeling pain is a vision worthy of praise and indicates that this girl will soon get, finally, a period of problems and difficulties and the beginning of a new life full of joy, pleasure, and life.

            "text": "Praying Taraweeh in a dream is a symbol of good and blessings, and the dreamer's life is full of happiness and peace. However, there are many details that can be seen which can change the content of the vision and the symbols it carries can be beneficial or harmful to a person, and this we will mention in the following lines on our site.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream. Many people have questions and inquiries about seeing the first Taraweeh prayer in a dream, and many legal translators have explained the meanings related to seeing prayer and its positive impact on a person's real life. \n\nSeeing prayer in general, whatever its time, and whether it is obligatory or a Sunnah, indicates goodness and justice for the visionary, after he is freed from all his worries and sorrows, and paves the way for him to succeed and achieve his goals because he is a pious man who always aims to draw closer to God Almighty with good speech and work.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream by Ibn Sirin. The scholar Ibn Sirin interprets seeing the Taraweeh prayer in a dream as carrying many auspicious signs that prove the strength of the dreamer's faith and the halal ways of earning money, as he stays away from all desires and temptations because he always desires to please God Almighty, and avoids forbidden and doubtful matters, and thanks to this his life is full of blessings and peace.\n\nHe also concluded his interpretations by explaining that seeing the dreamer of a group of people praying Taraweeh in front of him in the street is evidence of his feeling confused and hesitant during that period of his life regarding a matter that requires him to make a careful choice, so as not to make a mistake, but he must be wise and rational before making the decision. So he achieves the desired results, God willing.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream for a single woman. Congratulations to the single girl who sees praying Taraweeh in a dream, as she turns into a distinguished girl who differs from other girls in terms of her unique qualities and moods, which makes those around her try to get close to her and want to engage with her, and the dream may be a good sign of her engagement or marriage, as she is close to a good young man who enjoys a high degree of morals and piety, so she finds in him the right life partner and a responsible father for her children in the near future, God willing.\n\nThe girl's participation in praying Taraweeh is evidence of her willingness to follow the correct behavior and principles that it is based on, and therefore she is keen to consult experts and scholars about the problems and obstacles she faces in her life, which makes her able to make the right decisions that preserve her good behavior among people, as the dream is evidence of facilitating her financial circumstances and passing the hardships and trials that she will soon face.\n\nHearing praying Taraweeh in a dream for a single woman. Hearing praying Taraweeh for an unmarried woman is like a message of reassurance about her good condition and that she will achieve the dreams she is striving for in the near future, and it is a symbol of the good tidings that will change her life positively and put her in a state of happiness and psychological tranquility, while her feeling of sadness when she hears the voice of the imam in the mosque indicates that she is experiencing problems and crises, so she must review her accounts to enjoy comfort and happiness.\n\nThe dream also wishes her to witness many successes and achievements in her future life as compensation for what she saw in the past of harsh events and went through many failures on the academic or practical level.\n\nInterpreting a dream of praying Taraweeh at home for a single woman. If the girl sees that her father is gathering family members to pray with them inside the house, this means that their lives will be filled with blessings and success, the dream is a good omen for the abundance of goodness and the abundance of provision for her and her family, and if she suffers from bad financial conditions and the size of worries and burdens increases on the head of the family, because this dream heralds a near relief and eases her circumstances and wishes her a bright future full of material prosperity and stability.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream for a married woman. If the married woman suffers from disagreements and disputes with her husband and their negative impact on her spirit and the entire family atmosphere, then seeing her praying Taraweeh is considered a good sign of calm and that both of them have the wisdom and rationality to overcome this crisis, because there is a degree of love and appreciation between them and a desire for each part to be by the side of the other.\n\nAs for the dreamer who sees that her husband is inviting her to pray with him inside the house, this indicates that he is a righteous husband, enjoys very good morals, and is always ready to treat his wife and children in a way that pleases God, and she must continue in his obedience and provide him with means of comfort and happiness unless he orders her to disobey, God forbid. The dream also portends an improvement in her financial conditions through her husband's promotion at work or in the development of his business, God willing.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream for a pregnant woman. Interpreters of interpretation interpret the pregnant woman's seeing of praying Taraweeh as a praiseworthy sign of easing the affairs of pregnancy and childbirth and avoiding health crises and obstacles that may have a negative impact on her health and the health of her fetus, and she is guided to good and does good deeds, so she receives the blessings of God and his provision.\n\nHer prayer in a dream also indicates the availability of blessings and goodness in her life and that the harsh circumstances she is going through will disappear and disappear in the near future, and in case of disagreements with her husband as a result of the pressures she feels at the present time, the circumstances will be settled with each other to a large extent, which makes her gain a degree of psychological comfort and peace.\n\nPraying Taraweeh in a dream for a divorced woman. Seeing praying Taraweeh for divorced women carries many good signs that herald the disappearance of the feelings of anxiety and psychological disturbances that she is experiencing at the present time, and it also represents good news for her about the happy events and happy days that she will soon spend, as compensation for what she saw in the past of misery and misery, and if she sees that her ex-husband is inviting her to pray with him, this is a good sign for her to return to him... \n"

            "text": "Symbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream: There are many signs and symbols of an imminent marriage in a dream, such as these symbols, when they appear in a dream, they may occupy the mind of the person because they do not know what they refer to, and therefore we will present the symbols and evidence that indicate an imminent wedding in a dream, quoting experts in dream interpretation.\n\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream – Ibn Sirin\nThe symbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream\nAmong the symbols that indicate an imminent marriage in the dreamer's dream, seeing jewelry and ornaments in different shapes in the dream, especially if the girl sees chains and necklaces in the dream, indicates that the dreamer will marry soon in reality.\n\nSome dream interpretation experts believe that seeing new clothes in a dream and wearing them is a sign of the fortune teller's marriage in the future, and even buying new clothes is a sign of the fortune teller's marriage in the near future.\n\nSeeing new houses in a dream also indicates an imminent marriage, and this applies to seeing the construction of a new house in a dream or buying that house, even just seeing a beautiful and new house has the same significance. As for if the house is gloomy, this may indicate an unsatisfying and unhappy marriage, God willing.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream for Ibn Sirin\nIbn Sirin, may God have mercy on him, said that seeing a gold bracelet decorated with silver is a sign that the fortune teller will marry soon. Ibn Sirin said that seeing the Basmala or hearing the call to prayer in a dream indicates the imminent marriage of the dreamer, and among these symbols is also seeing one of the wives of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace.  Just as seeing a rabbit in a dream indicates the imminent marriage of the fortune teller in reality.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream for an unmarried woman\nAmong the symbols that indicate an imminent marriage for an unmarried woman is seeing the hijab in a dream. If the unmarried woman sees the white wedding dress in a dream, this is an indication that the dreamer will marry soon, but if the wedding dress is tight or revealing, then the vision is not good and indicates that the girl's marriage will be delayed for a short time.\n\nSeeing eating, buying or taking an apple from someone indicates the nearness of the unmarried woman's marriage, according to what Al-Nabulsi mentioned in his interpretation of the symbols of marriage in a dream.\nSeeing arranging, folding and cleaning clothes in a dream for an unmarried woman means that the seer will marry soon, and henna also indicates that the unmarried dreamer will marry soon.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream for a married woman\nThe vision of a married woman seeing the symbols and meanings of marriage differs in its interpretation from the vision of an unmarried woman for these symbols.\n\nIf a married woman sees that her husband is marrying her again in a dream and she is happy about it in the dream, this indicates that the seer enjoys stability in her marital life and enjoys peace and a comfortable life.\n\nIf the married woman sees that her husband is marrying another woman in a dream, and the fortune teller is smiling and content, this indicates that the fortune teller's husband is not thinking of marrying another woman, but rather loves and appreciates his wife.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream for a pregnant woman\nIf a pregnant woman dreams that her husband is marrying her again, the vision indicates that the woman may give birth to a boy.\n\nSeeing gold in a dream indicates that the seer will give birth to a girl.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a dream for a divorced woman\nAmong the symbols that Al-Nabulsi said indicate an imminent marriage for the ruler who sees new doors in a dream in all their types.\n\nDream interpretation scholars believe that the final vision of butterflies with beautiful colors and wonderful shapes is an indication that the seer will marry soon, God willing.\nSymbols that indicate a divorced woman's marriage again\nSeeing the divorced woman arranging her bed in a dream means that the divorced woman will marry again, and there are a number of birds and animals that indicate the imminent marriage of the seer, such as the peacock, pigeon, and small white cats.\nIn the event that the divorced woman sees the full moon in the sky in her dream, this means that the dreamer will succeed in marrying someone of high status, and it will be a very good reason for the dreamer to find her happiness again and enjoy a peaceful and stable life.\n\nOne of the strong symbols of an imminent marriage for a divorced woman in a dream is to see her perfumed with musk or to maintain chastity in the dream for the divorced and widowed woman as well.\nSymbols that indicate an imminent marriage in a man's dream\nIbn Sirin said that seeing an unmarried young man slaughtering birds such as sparrows and pigeons in a dream means that the seer will marry soon from a virgin girl.\n\nSeeing the dreamer of the colors of the rainbow in the dream, or seeing what is called the rainbow from the rain, is a strong indicator of an imminent marriage for a young man or bachelor.\nIbn Sirin, may God have mercy on him, said that seeing a bachelor eating fruit, especially grapes, in a dream indicates that the seer will marry, and if the dreamer sees himself eating sweet black grapes in a dream, this indicates that the seer will marry. The seer will marry a woman of beauty and wealth.\nThree symbols that indicate an imminent marriage in reality\nAmong the symbols that indicate the imminent marriage of the fortune teller or the fortune teller in reality, seeing fried fish in a dream or eating it, especially if the fortune teller is a bachelor, as well as seeing henna engravings and buying henna in a dream.\n\nSeeing the purchase of home furniture in a dream is one of the signs and symbols that indicate the imminent marriage of the fortune teller.\n\nIn the event that the fortune teller is a young unmarried man and he sees in a dream a girl stripped of her mother's hijab, this indicates that this young man will marry soon in reality.\nSymbols that indicate the nearness of marriage to a person ... \n"
