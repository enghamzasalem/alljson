Interpretation of a dream about a plane landing for a single woman by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin said that the symbol of a plane landing Peace appears in the dreamer's life, but the condition is that the plane lands safely in the dream and the dreamer gets off it happy and not afraid. If the dreamer is planning to travel outside the country and sees the plane landing safely in the dream, then her trip will go smoothly, and if she is one of those who are afraid of flying, then The scene assures her that the Lord of the Worlds will protect her throughout the journey. If the dreamer is looking for a job stronger than her current job and sees this dream, she will receive a strong job offer that will move her from a state of austerity to a state of wealth and financial stability. If the dreamer boards the plane in the dream and watches it take off Then she got down and out of it and arrived at a strange but beautiful place. She would change her life with a radical change that would benefit her both in and out of it. "
