Thus, seeing fat cows is a sign of goodness and prosperity that the dreamer will experience this year, and therefore thin cows are a sign of drought and poverty. Seeing cow products, such as meat or dairy products, indicates the abundance of money that the dreamer will earn in the near future. As for speaking With cows in a dream, it is a sign of a lot of livelihood that he will obtain, which people will hear about and talk about soon.
