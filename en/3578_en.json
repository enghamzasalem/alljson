Most of the dreams in which the sister’s husband appears in the dream of an unmarried woman have psychological and complex reasons that are sometimes examined. Interpretation of dreams is from the conversations of the soul, and therefore does not carry any interpretation. Sometimes an unmarried woman sees in her dream as if her sister’s husband is marrying her, and this is one of the common visions. However, its interpretation is divided into three sections: marriage or marriage events, without what happens between the husband and wife between them, and perhaps this interpretation is good and indicates goodness that she will get from her sister or something similar. The second is for the girl to see her wedding ceremony with her sister’s husband, accompanied by wedding offers. Such as drumming, singing, crying, and dancing, and this is not welcome in the interpretation of visions, because it indicates the occurrence of a quarrel, competition, or hostility between the unmarried woman and her sister.

Social differences often appear in the house of brothers, as some of them marry rich, and some marry Poor, some marry unemployed, sick, disabled, elderly, and so on. When a woman is unhappy in her marriage for material or emotional reasons, her sister’s husband appears in her dream as subconscious compensation for a certain deprivation. It is considered good in a dream on the condition that the sister’s husband appears in a married woman’s dream in a decent appearance and does not commit a shameful act or behavior that would shake his image that the married woman is accustomed to in reality or awake. Interpretation of the appearance of the sister’s husband in a pregnant woman’s dream: The interpretation of the sister’s husband to a pregnant woman does not differ from the aforementioned interpretations. Above is for single and married women, but in this paragraph we can add another dimension that differs from the psychological or social dimension, which is the spiritual dimension because the pregnant woman in our Eastern and Arab societies has more spiritual qualities than ever before, because she sometimes sees acceptance from her sister’s husband and has human qualities or tolerance, Therefore, it is more beautiful than wakefulness. And in his words there are positive messages written by the subconscious mind in fact! But she pushed it in the words of her sister’s husband, perhaps because she respected him so much, or perhaps the feelings of brotherhood between them were so strong. ",
