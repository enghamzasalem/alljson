A black man in a dream is always interpreted as pessimism and bad news, but there are some exceptions in which a black man in a dream can be a sign of goodness. Seeing a black man in a dream Interpretation of a black man in a dream If he is smiling, this is an indication On the positive news that the dreamer will be happy with, his family crises will disappear, and all his professional problems will be solved, as well as his family and social problems. A smile in general in a dream is a praiseworthy symbol. If the black man in the dream is frowning and angry, this indicates the presence of adversity and distress in the dreamer’s life. The interpretation of the black man in the dream indicates happiness and joy if he has gifts such as fruits and fruits, and the fresher these fruits are And edible, the better the scene and its more promising connotations. Seeing a black person is interpreted as goodness and happiness, if he is a police officer or a judge. If a married woman sees a black face in a dream, this means that she will face problems in her life that she will not be able to overcome. A black man in a dream Al-OsaimiWhen Seeing a familiar person with a black face, the interpretation of this dream is that these people need material, psychological or moral help. Seeing a famous person in a dream with a black face can be interpreted as this person’s illness. Seeing a familiar person in a dream with a black face and wearing white clothes means That he will be blessed with a girl whose livelihood will be great and who will be the reason for his happiness.

Seeing an unmarried woman with a black face in a dream means that this girl will face a problem, and the dreamer will help her get out of this problem easily Interpretation of a dream about a black man by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin disagreed with a large number of jurists who praised the vision of a young man with brown hair, and said that the appearance of a man with dark skin in a dream has many disgusting connotations, such as: First: In reference to sadness and happiness in leaving the dreamer’s home. Ibn Sirin realized that the period during which the dreamer feels anxious and sad will be short and we will give examples of bad events that will happen to the dreamer: He may feel weak and physically weak and after a medical examination he will be surprised that he is sick and needs a period of cessation from work and daily tasks to recover from the illness. If the dreamer feels upset In her job, the vision may reveal that she will leave the job and suffer a period of unemployment, after which she will regain her professional activity by entering a comfortable job other than the previous job. Perhaps the interpretation of the dream is that the dreamer’s financial conditions will drop to the level of drought and poverty and he will live in misery for a short period. Perhaps the anxiety that the dreamer will experience Soon it translates that one of his children will fall victim to an illness, but he must be sure that all these circumstances are temporary and will pass successfully and without loss.
