            "html": " Interpretation of seeing water coming down the wall in a dream by Ibn Sirin The science of interpreting dreams and visions is one of the sciences in which many Muslim scholars excelled, such as Ibn Sirin, Al-Sadiq, Abu Ali, Al-Nabulsi, Ibn Shaheen, and others. From the verses of the Holy Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet, in this article we will learn about the interpretation of Ibn Sirin’s vision of water coming down from the wall in a dream. Interpretation of seeing water coming down the wall in a dream by Ibn Sirin Interpretation of seeing water coming down from the wall has many benefits mentioned in the Holy Qur’an in the Almighty’s saying: (And We made from water every living thing). The interpretation of seeing water falling from the wall in a dream, including Ibn Sirin, came as follows: Interpretation of seeing water coming down from the wall To see clear water falling in a dream means a lot of sustenance and enormous wealth that the dreamer must enjoy. In addition, if the dreamer sees dirty, impure water coming down from the wall of the house, this is evidence that the dreamer and his family have committed sins and transgressions, and this vision is also evidence of not performing prayers. But when the dreamer sees in a dream that water is coming down from the wall of the house, this is a sign and an indication that he has some worries, problems and sorrows that will disturb him and control the owner of the house. As for the unmarried girl who sees in her dream that water is coming down from the wall of her house, this indicates her close marriage to a righteous and pious man with whom she lives happily. As for if the divorced woman sees water coming down from the wall, this is evidence of getting rid of the pain, sadness and problems she faces. See also: Interpretation of a dream about giving a ring to a single and married man by Ibn Sirin Interpretation of a dream about water on the floor of the house in a dream by Ibn Sirin Interpretation of seeing water coming down from the wall Imam Ibn Sirin excelled in the science of dream interpretation and has many books and books in interpreting the different dreams that the dreamer sees as interpretations of the dreams of the Imam himself. The vision differed according to the circumstances surrounding the visionary, whether she was married, divorced, pregnant or single, so Ibn Sirin's interpretation of seeing water coming down from the wall in a dream is as follows: Ibn Sirin said, in interpreting the vision of water coming down from the wall, that if an unmarried girl sees that the floor of the house is full of water, this is evidence of a poor choice of a good marriage and also shows her failure in emotional life. In addition, if a married woman sees water on the floor of the house, this indicates the possibility of her being exposed to major problems with her husband that may lead to divorce and separation. In general, seeing water on the floor of the house indicates the possibility of debts accumulating on the viewer, in addition to losing his job, as well as facing many major crises in his life. The interpretation of this vision can also be in a pregnant woman’s dream that she is facing problems in her pregnancy, as well as some simple fears during pregnancy and difficulty in childbirth. And if he sees that water is on the floor of his house, it is a sign of the ordeal, difficulties and problems that the seer faces in his life.
