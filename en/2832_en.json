Interpretation of Ibn Sirin’s vision of red bricksIbn Sirin is one of the famous scholars of dream interpretation. Ibn Sirin worked hard to interpret the vision of bricks in a dream, and he said: Red bricks in a dream are a symbol of pride, strength, solidity, and superiority. If a man sees red bricks in his dream, this indicates that this man has the qualities of superiority, pride, and strength. This strength may come from his personality or It may come from his influence. This happens if this man occupies a high position in society or if one of his relatives has power, influence and rank, then this man’s influence and power stem from that relative. "
