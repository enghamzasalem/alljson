The disaster lies, so do not make yourself a victim of life's emergency and its accumulated fears, so that you do not return and regret those who abandoned you. In this article, we will learn about the interpretation of disputes in a dream. Interpretation of seeing a fight in a dream Fighting in a dream or competition between people may be, as psychologists explain, due to the negative or evil energy present within the person who had the vision. The fortune teller may have gone through a bad situation, but he could not express his inner anger, so it appeared in the form of dreams in his sleep. Interpretation of seeing a fight with the family in a dream All family disputes or problems that the viewer dreams of do not mean that the dreamer feels hatred or malice towards a member of his family, but as psychologists have indicated, it may be more than emptying the negative accusations that the dreamer feels, an ordinary person. If the dreamer sees that he is quarreling with his parents and quarreling with them in his dream, this indicates the dreamer's need for love, care and tenderness from his family, and the more intense the quarrels and quarrels in his sleep, the older he is. The dreamer needs tenderness and kindness. If one of the parents hits the dreamer in a dream, this is a sign that the dreamer is taking advantage of his parents. If the vision revolves around problems and disputes between the two brothers and each other, this indicates the extent of love, compatibility and harmony between the two brothers with each other. There is no harm or justification for the disputes that control the wife or husband, whether it is a dispute with the partner or partner or with the husband's family and, consequently, with the wife's family. The whole thing is nothing but a discharge of charge and energy resulting from the daily events and problems that the partner is going through. Interpretation of seeing a quarrel between friends in a dream A quarrel between friends is one of the most disturbing visions among people, but it is one of the good visions that has a good interpretation, even if the dispute between them escalates to the point of a fight or a fight. Here we find that disagreements in dreams mean harmony and friendship between friends. And understanding between friends. Interpretation of seeing a dispute in a dream according to Ibn Sirin’s interpretation Ibn Sirin believes that anyone who curses his parents in a dream is a sign that the dreamer was obstructing his parents.
