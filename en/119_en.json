Interpretation of the dream of cancer in a dream by Ibn Sirin A person's dream that he is sick with cancer may indicate his inner feeling and deep psychological disturbance. It does not affect his dream of being afflicted with an organic disease, or warn him of being afflicted with this disease at all.

May God protect us and you from all harm and keep you in God’s care and safety. Interpretation of seeing cancer in a dream by Ibn Shaheen Ibn Shaheen explains that whoever sees himself suffering from cancer in a dream, this is a commendable interpretation, It is a sign of the health and strength of the body, and symbolizes the improvement of the dreamer's conditions.
