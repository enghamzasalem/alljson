            "html": " Interpretation of seeing an important figure in a dream? The dreamer can see in his dream many important figures such as actors, singers, football players and politicians. The appearance of these characters in a dream carries many clues. Therefore, we decided on an Egyptian website to provide an interpretation of each one separately so that the dreamer can reveal the meaning of his dream through the following lines. Interpretation of the dream of seeing an important person. In order to be able to present all the interpretations of the appearance of an important figure in the dream, we must divide the important figures into categories: First: Interpreting the visions of actors about appearance, Miller pointed out that a man who loves the world and seeks to enjoy it will see actors in his dream, but the dreamer must know something important, which is that pleasure must have limits because if he continues to search for it in all its forms and types. He will find himself drawn to the forbidden path and will ignore his religion. Therefore, it is better for him to look for means of halal pleasure, such as marriage, so as not to expose himself to divine punishment, and then he will acquire his world and religion. If the dreamer sees an actor in his dream, perhaps the interpretation indicates his strong admiration for some of the characteristics and qualities that This actor has it, which means that a lot of girls like a particular actress because of her beauty and many attractive features of her qualities as she is. Elegant and wearing expensive clothes will therefore appear to them in their dreams. Many young people may dream that they are acting in a dream. Miller said that this scene symbolizes the solidity of the dreamer's mission in waking life, but despite its difficulty, it will be a great reason for the fulfillment of his desires soon. Thus, this dream gives the dreamer great hope that the difficulties they are experiencing in reality and the difficult professions they work in to save the money that It makes them live a simple life, which will be the reason for their success and excellence later. They must be patient and leave the matter to God. Miller put two other pieces of evidence to complete the interpretation of the dreamer’s vision of becoming a famous actor in the dream: The first evidence: It is his great desire to prove himself while he is awake. He wants everyone to respect him, and he seeks to become a celebrity who has fingerprints. Clear on society. The second evidence: The dreamer loves elegance and cares a lot about his appearance, clothing, and general cleanliness in waking life. If the dreamer sees that he will participate in a series and the director gives him the role of the second actor, the interpretation of this vision shows two signs: The first evidence: The visionary’s need to provide as much as possible. From a helping hand to all the people around him. The second evidence: That there is a person who loves the dreamer very much, and whose presence is an essential factor in his life. If the dreamer sees an actress in his dream and her mood and psychological state are very bad, then this scene in the dream indicates that the dreamer’s friend will soon fall He is in distress, and he may fall ill with an incurable disease or accumulate debt, but the fortuneteller will not let his friend’s condition get worse from this, and will offer him all means of rescue until a smile is again drawn on his face.

Interpretation of the dream of seeing an important person. In order to be able to present all the interpretations of the appearance of an important figure in the dream, we must divide the important figures into categories: First: Interpreting the visions of actors about appearance, Miller pointed out that a man who loves the world and seeks to enjoy it will see actors in his dream, but the dreamer must know something important, which is that pleasure must have limits because if he continues to search for it in all its forms and types. He will find himself drawn to the forbidden path and will ignore his religion. Therefore, it is better for him to look for means of halal pleasure, such as marriage, so as not to expose himself to divine punishment, and then he will acquire his world and religion. If the dreamer sees an actor in his dream, perhaps the interpretation indicates his strong admiration for some of the characteristics and qualities that This actor has it, which means that a lot of girls like a particular actress because of her beauty and many attractive features of her qualities as she is. Elegant and wearing expensive clothes will therefore appear to them in their dreams. Many young people may dream that they are acting in a dream. Miller said that this scene symbolizes the solidity of the dreamer's mission in waking life, but despite its difficulty, it will be a great reason for the fulfillment of his desires soon. Thus, this dream gives the dreamer great hope that the difficulties they are experiencing in reality and the difficult professions they work in to save the money that It makes them live a simple life, which will be the reason for their success and excellence later. They must be patient and leave the matter to God. Miller put two other pieces of evidence to complete the interpretation of the dreamer’s vision of becoming a famous actor in the dream: The first evidence: It is his great desire to prove himself while he is awake. He wants everyone to respect him, and he seeks to become a celebrity who has fingerprints. Clear on society. The second evidence: The dreamer loves elegance and cares a lot about his appearance, clothing, and general cleanliness in waking life. If the dreamer sees that he will participate in a series and the director gives him the role of the second actor, the interpretation of this vision shows two signs: The first evidence: The visionary’s need to provide as much as possible. From a helping hand to all the people around him. The second evidence: That there is a person who loves the dreamer very much, and whose presence is an essential factor in his life. If the dreamer sees an actress in his dream and her mood and psychological state are very bad, then this scene in the dream indicates that the dreamer’s friend will soon fall He is in distress, and he may fall ill with an incurable disease or accumulate debt, but the fortuneteller will not let his friend’s condition get worse from this, and will offer him all means of rescue until a smile is again drawn on his face.
