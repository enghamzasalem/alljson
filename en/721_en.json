            "html": " A dream about a sick dead person shows that he is asking you for begging or charity and other interpretations that we will interpret for single, married, pregnant, divorced, unmarried and unmarried women. A young married man like seeing the deceased tired or in the hospital or complaining of head or back pain or seeing the deceased dying or suffering from neck or abdominal pain. Or a man or person who died of cancer according to Ibn Sirin, Imam Al-Sadiq, Al-Nabulsi and others. There are many interpretations and clues about the interpretation of seeing a dead patient in a dream, which a person must know in order to obtain the correct interpretation, and we will reveal some of them as interpreted by Ibn Sirin, the translator. Al-Kabir. Interpretation of the dead in a dream. The illness of a dead person in a dream often indicates that there is a responsibility that he violated in his life, or that there is a weakness in his religion that calls for supplication for him and zakat on him. Pain in any of the deceased’s organs can indicate something: for example, seeing The deceased complains about his head in a dream, because he is responsible for his negligence in the affairs of his mother or his boss. Seeing the deceased complaining about his neck indicates his responsibility for losing money or his wife’s dowry. Seeing his complaint on his hand indicates his responsibility for his brother or partner or taking a false oath. Complaining about The side is responsible for the rights of the wife. If the deceased complains about his stomach, this indicates his responsibility for the rights of the child and his relatives. Seeing the dead person complaining about his feet indicates his responsibility to spend his money on matters other than pleasing God Almighty. If his thigh complains, then he is responsible for severing the relationship. And sweat. And if he complains about his legs, then he is responsible for wasting his life in a lie. The imam mentioned in the interpretation of this vision that it indicates a reprehensible act committed by the deceased during his life, and this act made him face what the deceased had not hoped for after his departure from life. And whoever sees in a dream that a dead person came while he was sick In a dream or a dream and his illness, aches and pains were in his head, the vision shows that the dead person was not fair to his parents. However, if the dead person was suffering from pain and pain in the position of the neck or neck, then the vision indicates that the dead person did not manage his money well and that he wasted it in the joy of life. Or he did not pay zakat. And alms. Whoever sees in a dream a dead person in pain and complaining of pain in his arm, the vision indicates that the dead person was the one who took care of his brothers’ affairs and did not fulfill their rights. Or that the dead person stole something during his lifetime, or that the dead person squandered and plundered his brother or sister’s money. Whether the money is from the estate or for any other reason. But if the dead person suffers from pain in one side or the waist, the vision indicates that the dead person wronged a woman in his life and did not fulfill her rights.
