If she wonders about her emotional conditions with this dream, it can be said that she is connected to a relative, and this happens if she sees someone she loves in reality, provided that he is happy and wearing organized and elegant clothes, while if she sees this person wearing ugly and torn clothes, then her emotional relationship is not good and she does not enjoy it. With no luck on her side. Sometimes a girl sees that she is talking to someone she knows.
