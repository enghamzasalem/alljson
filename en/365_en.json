The dead, Ibn Sirin, and others. Condolences in a dream are among the very frightening dreams that we see in our dreams, and they give us dread and fear because of the meanings the dream carries in our lives. Condolences indicate the death of a person in life, and sometimes we see that we receive condolences in a dream from the people closest to us, such as our parents or sisters. Or the husband, which causes us a state of anxiety to know the correct interpretation and meaning of the dream to end the anxiety. Imam Ibn Sirin, the great interpreter of dreams, explained the vision of solace in a dream with many great and important interpretations and meanings that must be known in reality and which carry many connotations that a person has. Interpretation Consolation in a dream, and consolation is safety, so whoever sees that he is relieving one who is afflicted will have a reward similar to his, and his reward is with God Almighty who wants safety, and whoever sees that he who comforts him will attain it.

As for the messengers and beggars for money, this is evidence of their need for people to relieve them of their misfortunes and harm. As for consolation, it is a wish. Whoever sees that he is consoling an injured person will have something similar to his money, for he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: Whoever comforts the injured person will have his reward.

And whoever sees that the one who consoles him will receive good news according to the words of God Almighty: (And the joy of those who befall them says: Indeed, we belong to God, and indeed indeed we belong to Him. Return.) The presence of a symbol of condolence in a dream is one of the dreams that may worry many people and make them fear...

Seeing condolences in a dream varies depending on the condition of the fortuneteller. As for greed in this world, condolences are an indication of their sympathy for the misfortunes, deaths, dangers and damage they may be exposed to in the future. Their lives. And whoever sees someone comforting him when he is in distress, this indicates prosperity and the disappearance of worry.
