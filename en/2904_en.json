            "html": " Contents: A dream of miscarriage in the dream of a pregnant woman, an unmarried girl and a married woman, the fetus falling from its mother’s womb, for the unmarried imam who dreamed that I had a miscarriage and saw the fetus. Interpretation of miscarriage or abortion of the fetus A miscarriage for a pregnant woman, unless she is worried about it, indicates that she will face some problems in childbirth, such as some pain, and this is normal for everyone. The vision of a miscarriage of the fetus returns between two things: If she wants to have an abortion, she will feel a state of fear and anxiety as the date of birth approaches, but nothing of her concern. If she looks with anxiety, sadness or fear at seeing the miscarriage, that is, forced to do so, or if she does not think about it in the dream, she will soon enter the stage of false labor. If she is at the beginning of her pregnancy, she should take care of her pregnancy; Because this is evidence that she is tired from the inside. As for the pregnant woman, when she sees blood during an abortion without seeing the fetus itself, this is all good and good, and it may indicate the fulfillment of a wish she had hoped for. Seeing blood and the fetus with it after the miscarriage, this indicates the food that the newborn brings to her husband or her family, or the good that will affect her home. If you are pregnant in reality and you saw an abortion in a dream, this may be due to your anxiety and fear of losing your fetus and the failure of the pregnancy. If you are pregnant in reality and you saw in your dream that you had an abortion without causing it, this means that your pregnancy will continue well. If you are pregnant in a dream and you saw that you decided to abort your fetus, this indicates the suffering that you will suffer in the coming days due to your bad behavior. Do not be afraid if you see menstrual blood in a dream if you are pregnant, this does not mean abortion and loss of the fetus, but rather it is good news for you because it symbolizes that what you wish for will come true. If a woman dreams that she agreed to an abortion for her or one of them, this means that there is a task that she is doing or doing that will It embarrasses her and brings her misery. Interpretation of abortion in a dream of a married woman who is not pregnant, but if you see a married woman who is not pregnant because she miscarried a fetus, this may indicate that she is pregnant, and if she has not been pregnant for a long time and has not given birth, it may not be a dream, but rather related to her thinking and emptying it inside her, and if she gave birth and saw the abortion, and if it was accompanied by pain, she will go through simple problems in her married life resulting from actions she did some time ago, and if it was not accompanied by pain, she will live a happy life for a period calculated from the age of pregnancy before the abortion, if she remembers that. And the married woman who is not pregnant, if the fetus is accompanied by blood during the abortion, she will have what she desires or happiness awaits her, and if it is in the dream without blood, it is a period of deficiency. From money and simple difficulties at the same time that may prevail in her home but she will release it better than before.
