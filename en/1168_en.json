On the authority of Ibn Sirin, Imam al-Sadiq and al-Nabulsi. Interpretation of the moon in a dream. Ibn Sirin says: The moon In a dream, there is a minister, a ruler, or a sultan, just as the stars in the sky are his soldiers and his soldiers, or their homes and their homes. The moon indicates the scholar, the sheikh, the imam, the director, the teacher, the noble, and every man around whom councils gather. The moon also indicates in the interpretation of dreams according to the Arabs: A good son, a good husband, a good and tolerant master. It may refer to a wife or daughter, if she is beautiful or has a bright light, as the Arabs say: like the full moon, or like the foot of the moon. Seeing the moon during the day and in the morning means that you will start a new work. Moonlight indicates romance and love and shows guidance. Seeing the moon in the light Dimness and clouds around it are a sign of obstacles that you face in your life. Seeing the full moon indicates great success, especially in your love life. The moonlight mainly shows family happiness. Seeing the absence of matter indicates the loss of the thing you are striving for. Whoever sees himself In the moon, the dream indicates death. The moon that turns into the sun in a dream portends a lot of goodness. The appearance of the moon in a dream indicates the emergence of something that you were hiding. If you see the moon covered with clouds, it means that the money is gone. It is said that a man came to his son Sirin and he told him a dream that he was looking at the sky and contemplating the moon, but he did not find it, and he looked at the earth and saw the moon disappearing, so Ibn Sirin answered him: If a man is rich, his money will go, but if he is poor, he will die, but if a woman sees this dream, her husband will die. The moon in A dream indicates an increase or decrease in money, because the moon in the sky waxes and disappears, waxes and disappears, and expands and contracts. As for the sick person or one afflicted with affliction or illness, if he sees the moon waxing, waning, or diminishing, then he will gradually recover from his illness. Whoever sees the moon in his hand or on his lap will get married this month. As for the one who sees in his dream that the moon is cracking or waning, if before that it was a blessing or blessing, then it passes, and if he was worried or distressed, then it disappears and goes. Among them is the full moon, meaning the full moon. Whoever sees it in its place in the sky will benefit from the order of the ruler or owner of the state. If he sees in a dream that a face is on the surface of the moon, then something as great as the face he saw will happen to him. As for whoever sees in his dream that he is hanging on the moon or floating on it, he will attain goodness and he will be rewarded by a generous person, a rich person, or a person with money and influence. As for whoever sees in his dream that the moon or full moon has turned into the sun, and thus night and day have become, then his wife will serve him well. The moon running in the sky among the stars and planets of the galaxy shows the man’s journey and the marriage of single people. Another interpretation of seeing the moon in a dream describes the moon in a dream and translates the dreamer’s feelings of nostalgia and intense emotion, as it is possible that the dreamer is living in a state of emotional thirst as a result of loneliness or loss.

On the authority of Ibn Sirin, Imam al-Sadiq and al-Nabulsi. Interpretation of the moon in a dream. Ibn Sirin says: The moon In a dream, there is a minister, a ruler, or a sultan, just as the stars in the sky are his soldiers and his soldiers, or their homes and their homes. The moon indicates the scholar, the sheikh, the imam, the director, the teacher, the noble, and every man around whom councils gather. The moon also indicates in the interpretation of dreams according to the Arabs: A good son, a good husband, a good and tolerant master. It may refer to a wife or daughter, if she is beautiful or has a bright light, as the Arabs say: like the full moon, or like the foot of the moon. Seeing the moon during the day and in the morning means that you will start a new work. Moonlight indicates romance and love and shows guidance. Seeing the moon in the light Dimness and clouds around it are a sign of obstacles that you face in your life. Seeing the full moon indicates great success, especially in your love life. The moonlight mainly shows family happiness. Seeing the absence of matter indicates the loss of the thing you are striving for. Whoever sees himself In the moon, the dream indicates death. The moon that turns into the sun in a dream portends a lot of goodness. The appearance of the moon in a dream indicates the emergence of something that you were hiding. If you see the moon covered with clouds, it means that the money is gone. It is said that a man came to his son Sirin and he told him a dream that he was looking at the sky and contemplating the moon, but he did not find it, and he looked at the earth and saw the moon disappearing, so Ibn Sirin answered him: If a man is rich, his money will go, but if he is poor, he will die, but if a woman sees this dream, her husband will die. The moon in A dream indicates an increase or decrease in money, because the moon in the sky waxes and disappears, waxes and disappears, and expands and contracts. As for the sick person or one afflicted with affliction or illness, if he sees the moon waxing, waning, or diminishing, then he will gradually recover from his illness. Whoever sees the moon in his hand or on his lap will get married this month. As for the one who sees in his dream that the moon is cracking or waning, if before that it was a blessing or blessing, then it passes, and if he was worried or distressed, then it disappears and goes. Among them is the full moon, meaning the full moon. Whoever sees it in its place in the sky will benefit from the order of the ruler or owner of the state. If he sees in a dream that a face is on the surface of the moon, then something as great as the face he saw will happen to him. As for whoever sees in his dream that he is hanging on the moon or floating on it, he will attain goodness and he will be rewarded by a generous person, a rich person, or a person with money and influence. As for whoever sees in his dream that the moon or full moon has turned into the sun, and thus night and day have become, then his wife will serve him well. The moon running in the sky among the stars and planets of the galaxy shows the man’s journey and the marriage of single people. Another interpretation of seeing the moon in a dream describes the moon in a dream and translates the dreamer’s feelings of nostalgia and intense emotion, as it is possible that the dreamer is living in a state of emotional thirst as a result of loneliness or loss.
