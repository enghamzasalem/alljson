Interpretation of speech in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Clear and expressive speech in a dream is praiseworthy, especially if it is Eloquent or with good expressions. If the dreamer hears sweet words such as praise or thanks, then in his waking life he expects to hear good news. Perhaps dreaming of a beautiful and elegant speech indicates the appearance of something happy in addition to the sweetness or sweetness of the words. As for expressing negative or bad expressions, it is in the dream. It expresses something bad, and perhaps the dream reveals negative thoughts or energy latent in the dreamer’s soul or in his subconscious. In a dream, it is advisable to speak foreign languages, provided that the speech is understandable and leads to a clear meaning. It is also praiseworthy to speak pure Arabic because Arabic is the language of the Qur’an. The Holy Prophet and the language of the hadiths of the Holy Prophet, which is one of the most common and widely used languages. Talking in a dream about what should be hidden is evidence of wasting money or wisdom on undeserving people. Ancient interpreters such as Ibn Sirin and Al-Nabulsi hated speaking in the language or style of poetry because poetry in interpretation expresses Hypocrisy, lying, and hypocrisy. Since speech in visions is similar to writing, both are interpreted according to the content of spoken or written statements. Gossip in a dream is abhorrent in Islamic and Western interpretations, as it has been attributed to the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche by saying: “The word kills the deed.” The best speech in The dream is what happens between him and him. This has positive effects. Spend them on what expresses self-control or self-restraint, and some of them express the purity and chastity of the soul. The best speech or speech is what is heard by wise men, sages, sheikhs, imams, teachers, professors, and those of the state or government, such as princes, presidents, and kings. As for the best speech and speech heard in visions, it is speech. God and messengers or angels and prophets. God’s words are praiseworthy and express the status and prestige of the seer. The words of the angels are good news or a warning, and whoever speaks in his dream to a prophet of the messengers such as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Yahya, Joseph, or Zechariah, he will have the same meaning as what was said or heard the words. Of the prophets is true. There is no prophet sent by God who speaks out of passion. Talking to the dead is real because they are in the house of truth, and talking to animals indicates prestige and authority. The basis of this interpretation is that the Prophet Solomon - may God bless him and grant him peace - addressed ants, ants and others, and this was mentioned in the stories of the Holy Qur’an.
