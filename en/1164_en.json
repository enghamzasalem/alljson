After mentioning the various connotations of cemeteries, we will explain what visiting graves symbolizes, whether during the day or at night. Interpretation of a dream about visiting a cemetery in a dream: Seeing graves in general is one of the visions that arouse panic and fear in the viewer because of this bad connection to reality, including that graves symbolize the end of life and the period The impending death, and seeing it makes the heart show severe fluctuations, leading to extreme exhaustion and loss of the ability to accomplish things. The graves symbolize imprisonment and the many restrictions that make the viewer lose enjoyment of life and living freely. These restrictions are not physical as much as they are moral, as they symbolize the prison in which he is imprisoned. Man cannot get out of it.

The grave can indicate imprisonment and negative feelings in the event that the dreamer sees that he is inside the grave while he is alive. If he sees that he is looking at graves and walking between the graves while they are open, then this is evidence of deviation from the path, prohibitions, and many sins and heresies in religion. Seeing visiting graves in a dream is one of the visions that carries more than one meaning, and each sign can be the opposite of the other, the dream and the one who visits it. If the visit is to a well-known person or known for his righteousness, it indicates the dreamer’s desire to acquire knowledge, increase his acquisition of knowledge, strive to walk in upright paths, and incline to accompany the righteous and learn from them.
