Where a person feels comfortable and calm simply by mentioning God, and there are many dhikr related to the Muslim, including reciting the correct morning purifications written through any reliable source, and there are many purifications and supplications that give a person happiness in his day, and also that a person remembers his Lord in a dream. It awakens a sense of security within him, because memories comfort souls at every moment and place, whether in ordinary life or in a dream. Interpretation of seeing supplications read in a dream by Ibn Sirin There are many interpretations related to dhikr, depending on the type of dhikr referred to in the dream, as well as the individual’s condition.

Interpretation of a dream about God Almighty: When he sees himself repeating the phrase, “Praise be to God, to Him belongs praise, and to His Lord is the Great.” It is the good news of the death of his distress, the relief of his distress, and the attainment of happiness and joy.

This is evidence of the imminent recovery and the disappearance of pain if the dreamer is sick, and the disappearance of his sadness if he is worried. It also indicates achieving great success in professional or personal life, and it also indicates paying off debts and fulfilling a promise. Interpretation of a dream about forgiveness: When you see a man asking for forgiveness in a dream. This indicates longevity, and seeking forgiveness indicates following a broad diet. Whoever sees that he withholds forgiveness in a dream, this indicates that he is a liar and a hypocrite. Asking forgiveness in a dream indicates achieving goals, repelling evil and sadness, and victory over enemies. Interpretation of seeing supplications read in a dream by Ibn Shaheen. Ibn Shaheen says that dreaming of glory God in a dream indicates the appearance of tension and anxiety, according to the Almighty’s saying: It indicates asking for forgiveness in a dream for sustenance in money and children, based on the verse “I said: Ask forgiveness from your Lord, because He used to forgive you (10) He will multiply for you Paradise (11) He will help you. With money and children, He makes you gardens and makes you rivers. Whoever dreams that he is asking forgiveness from God Almighty after he has finished his prayer with his face toward the Qiblah, this indicates that God will answer his prayers, but if his face is not in the direction of the Qiblah.
