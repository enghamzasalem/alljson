            "html": " In this topic, we will learn about the interpretation of a snake bite in a dream, “snake bites in a dream.” The snake is considered one of the most terrifying animals that humans fear, because it causes him harm that often leads to death, so seeing it in a dream causes panic and anxiety in the viewer, especially if he dreams that a snake bites him, which makes him search for a logical interpretation of the dream he had. Interpretation of a snake bite in a dream in an encyclopedia, which is a type of reptile that humans fear because of the harm it can cause him, which may lead to death, and therefore seeing it in a dream, especially a bite or bite of the sleeper, causes discomfort to the seer, and is described as a nightmare more than a dream. Dream interpretation jurists dealt with seeing a snake in a dream and the connotations associated with it, which differ depending on whether the seer is male, single or married, and other cases of seeing it in a dream. Interpretation of a snake bite in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin believes that a snake bite in a dream indicates a disease that the seer suffers from. If a person dreams that a snake has bitten him on his left hand, this means that he has committed sins and disobedience. But if the bite is in the right hand It is one of the well-interpreted visions, because it means that the dreamer will get a lot of money soon. Whoever sees that a snake has bitten him on the head, his dream indicates that he is suffering from anxiety and psychological crises as a result of his haste in making wrong decisions. Interpretation of a snake bite in a dream by Ibn Shaheen The scholar Ibn Shaheen says: If a person dreams that a snake has bitten him, the dream indicates his recovery from illness if he is sick and his marriage if he is single. The bite of a black snake in a dream indicates that the dreamer will be severely harmed by someone close to him, and the vision may indicate his pain due to a conspiracy hatched by someone. The attack of a yellow snake in a dream symbolizes the dreamer's suffering from illness and psychological problems. Whoever sees in a dream that a snake has bitten him on his leg, his dream shows the victory of his enemy over him, which causes him many worries and problems that make him unable to achieve the goals he seeks. Imam Ibn Shaheen believes that a snake biting the dreamer on his leg indicates that this person will be exposed to many problems and troubles in his life, which will prevent him from achieving what he seeks And he hopes to reach it.
