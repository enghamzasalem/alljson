Whoever sees that he is in many deep waters, and descends into them and does not reach their bottom, then he will be affected by many worldly matters and will be financed, and it is said that he will fall into them. The subject of a great man. Ibn Sirin was asked about a woman who had a vision of watering water, and he said: This woman fears God and does not seek falsehood among people. Then a man came to him and said to him: I saw as if I was drinking cold, delicious water from a piece of my clothing, so he said: Fear God and do not be alone with a woman other than him. You are allowed to do it. Whoever dreams that he drinks very fresh water, he will live a long life and a dignified life, and if he drinks it from the sea, he will receive money from the king, and if he drinks it from the river, he will receive. From a man whose condition among people is like a river among rivers. If drinking in a dream is an unknown drink or sweet water, this indicates guidance, knowledge and taste. Whoever drinks cold, sweet water earns legitimate money, and it is good for everyone except the one who drinks it. And whoever sees that he drinks cold water It is harmful to legitimate money, and it has been said that the vision of being irrigated is better than thirst, and drinking from all types of beverages by placing each type in its vessel and drinking it. From the seas, rivers, springs, and wells, which are detailed in his section. Drinking: If a woman dreams of drinking happily, this indicates that she is associated with actions that shame her, even if she finds pleasure in it. If she dreams that she does not drink clean water despite her best efforts to do so, then she will not enjoy the pleasures that are flatteringly offered to her. Drinking any drink that has a yellow color in a dream is a disease. Whoever dreams that he drank dumplings, or cheese, or drank violets, then he He recovers from the disease or takes refuge in it. From something harmful or avoiding it, he will obtain something that cures his sickness and disease. And if he is seen drinking honey syrup, apple syrup, or myrtle syrup, and every delicious drink like that, then it is good for the rich to open it, and for the poor it is bad because they do not open their eyes. Such drinks are only a disease that afflicts them and forces them to drink them. Apple drink is a blessing from a servant or a favor from a strict man, and a world in which there is sadness. Whoever drinks a drink in a dream for a reason indicates its disappearance, if any, otherwise his drinking indicates the occurrence of this disease. A drink of a separate nature indicates generosity or divulging secrets, justice and waste, and what calms the clinking of drinks shows paths, and kindness to enemies and opponents, and repelling opponents with good policy, as well as What calms. Heat. As for drinks that open the liver, they are mechanical or legal etiquette, resolving matters, keeping secrets, and what appears in color indicates joys, pleasures, and good fortune. Drinking roses, linoleum, and feces shows weakness and lack of trust in the promiser, due to their lack of survival. Perhaps the noise indicates the woman’s sadness. "
