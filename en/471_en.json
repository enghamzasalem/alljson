What concerns us in this article is that we study all the connotations, situations and symbols expressed by seeing gold, the special interpretation of the dream of being given a gold earring, and the difference in interpretation between single, married and pregnant women. Learn about the interpretation of the dream of being given a gold earring Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of the dream of giving a gold earring: Seeing gold indicates prosperity, wealth, abundance of gains, successive material and spiritual gains, removing obstacles, the ability to overcome obstacles, and enjoying tremendous powers that help a person achieve his goals. This vision also indicates the emotional, psychological, and material state of the individual, longevity, health, and tangible progress on earth. And great successes and fruitful achievements. If we resort to the interpretation of jurisprudence, we find Nablus. He went on to say that gold is disliked in the vision and represents sadness, anxiety, the burden of life, difficult circumstances, and many problems that prevent the viewer from living in peace and succeeding crises. And whoever sees that he is wearing a ring or something made of gold, this indicates The company of men who do not deserve him, or marriages that harm him and his evil. Seeing a gift of a golden earring indicates the intention of getting married or starting a new experience from which the dreamer will achieve his desire. The same previous vision is an indication of the institutions and companies that the person is determined to do, and the many torches of life and entering into a whirlpool of Duties and responsibilities that occupy all his time. And if a man sees that he is wearing a gold earring, this indicates his weakness, weakness, weakness, inability to set priorities, difficulty in making strict decisions, and his submission to the opinions of others. Interpretation of a dream about giving a gold earring to Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin believes that Seeing gold is one of the visions that is not good. He also adds that the word gold comes from gold, meaning the going and loss of things. Circumstances that drain his time, effort, and energy. If he sees that his house is made of gold, this indicates that a major fire will break out in it, and his valuable possessions may be looted or lost due to his wrong decisions and narrow view of things. But the interpretation of a dream about being given a gold earring indicates imprisonment, distress, severe crisis, and exposure to distress. Finances prevent the viewer from reaching his goal and achieving his desired goals and the difficulties he faces to reach safety. On the other hand, seeing a golden earring indicates marriage, precious gifts, and entering into a serious relationship aimed at building a legitimate emotional relationship in which he shares life with whomever his heart chooses. If The golden earring was indicative of marriage. The interpretation of marriage according to many jurists is imprisonment or restrictions that surround God and deprive him of living in peace and comfort. If the viewer sees that he is exposing his neck to a woman, this indicates his desire to get close to her. "
