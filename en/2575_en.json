It is replaced by cold air and clouds begin to gather through it, but what about seeing thunder in a dream? Interpretation of a dream about thunder in a dream The interpretation of this vision varies from one person to another and from one social status to another.

But the dream came directly to the seer. If the person who hears thunder is in debt, then this dream is good news indicating that he will pay off the debt, and the difference in the time in which the vision of thunder occurs leads to a difference in interpretation, as: Al-Nabulsi explained that seeing thunder on the second day of September indicates the occurrence of poverty and famine at the beginning of the year and the provision of abundant and plentiful food at the end of the year. Seeing thunder in a dream for Ibn Sirin The sound of thunder in a dream indicates the threat of the ruler and the fear of the seer from him.

Seeing it in the sky is evidence of the issuance of orders from the ruler, and if it is followed by rain, it indicates that the ruler brings good to the ruling class, but it is stipulated that the rain does not harm or affect the person. Surrounding places. If thunder is accompanied by rain that harms the dreamer or those around him, this may indicate the emergence of some problems at work. If thunder occurs at sunrise and without rain, this brings good news to the dreamer. If thunder is accompanied by pitch darkness and majestic sounds, this may indicate the spread of some harmful weather pests such as locusts and others, or the occurrence of severe cold and winds, or the occurrence of an epidemic and the death of infected people. That is because the vision in general does not bring good. Seeing thunder for a prisoner is evidence of his release. Only the sound of thunder in a dream indicates disputes and disagreements. Thunder in a single woman's dream The sound of thunder in dreams Most dream interpreters unanimously agreed that the sound of thunder in an unmarried woman's dream is interpreted in two different ways, according to the girl's vision and feeling of the appearance of thunder: First person: If the sound of thunder is terrifying and terrifying, this indicates the girl who is afraid of the sound of thunder: The instability of the psychological state of the single woman, as it is a sign of anxiety and excessive anxiety about the future.
