He wakes up panting. What is the interpretation of this vision and what are its implications? This is what we will learn through our topic today. The interpretation of a dream of descending the stairs in a dream, in general, comes from visions that do not bode well for its owner.

Seeing this, he will fall from this position. As for falling quickly, these are serious changes in the fortuneteller’s life, all of which lead to evil. If he is rich, he will be exposed to bankruptcy or at least serious financial difficulties. The vision may also indicate commendable connections from the point of view of some commentators, Some people said that it is evidence of abundant goodness that the dreamer comes without much effort on his part. The dream of a staircase generally symbolizes the adversities or distresses that a person is exposed to in his life and whether he will be able to overcome them and overcome them or submit to them. And whoever sees the stairs in His dream, he actually has a goal to strive for, and as long as goals are found, there will be obstacles. The road is not always paved for what a person wants, and whoever desires success must bear the challenges he faces. This symbol can have connotations of good or evil, as Al-Nabulsi and Ibn Shaheen mentioned that lineage is evidence of being immersed in worries and problems. It can symbolize the presence of a person It is more important to him and he wants to reach it, but he suffers because of that, and if he sees himself going down the stairs, then his descent could be a sign of his inability to reach this person’s heart. Therefore, it is one of the visions that raises feelings of despair and frustration in many, and this is what most have confirmed. Interpretation scholars. However, there are still some positive indicators that can be summarized in the fact that the dreamer has reached the ambition he seeks, but after suffering because of the obstacles he finds on his way. Interpretation of the dream of descending the stairs by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin said: If he descends the stairs in a dream It means falling into the abyss, and that he will suffer failure in life, whether he is a student of knowledge or a busy person. But if the dreamer is traveling outside his country, he will soon return to his country, and if he is sick or one of his family members is suffering from an illness, then the dream indicates his death. But if The dreamer came down from above to take something down and run, he will soon achieve his goal. If the stairs lead to a far place on the ground, this is evidence of a problem that could lead to imprisonment, so he must stop and review his steps and decisions at this point. As Ibn Sirin said in his interpretation This dream means that whoever descends the stairs will fall ill or suffer from a serious crisis in his life. Descending the stairs in a dream for a single woman. Interpretation of a dream of descending the stairs for an unmarried woman indicates the suffering she suffers from. ",
