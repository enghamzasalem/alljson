Money and the famous position that the dreamer will reach in his life by order of God. But if the king in the dreamer’s dream is one of the kings of the West, then this is evidence of the injustice that will happen to the pioneer and he will suffer greatly from it, and God is Most High and Most Knowing. Interpretation of a dream about the king visiting the house. Jurists differed in the interpretation of the king’s visit to His house in the dreamer’s dream, and the interpretation was divided into two cases according to the state of the king in the dream, for example: Ibn Sirin believes that seeing the king visiting the priest’s house in his dream was for that man who possesses a lot of wealth, power, and prestige that the priest would succeed in his life and reach the highest positions.
