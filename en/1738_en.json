What are the meanings and interpretations of the vision? This is what we will discuss together in this article with an Egyptian website. Seeing an old friend in a dream: Dreaming about an old friend indicates joy and happiness in life, as well as the dreamer’s need to meet this close friend. Seeing a friend expresses the presence of some things on the dreamer’s mind that he wants to talk about, But if he sees his friend in good health, it means that he will visit him soon in reality. Seeing a close friend smiling means that you will soon hear good news, while sitting with a childhood friend indicates the dreamer’s desire to return to his old behaviors and his desire for positive change and moving away from his negative actions. Seeing Childhood friends is a psychological vision, and Miller said that people who always see childhood friends in a dream are lonely people who are always searching for themselves and want to talk and show what is in their hearts. To see a friend in a high and radiant place is good news for the dreamer that he will obtain a prominent position, and expresses Also about the emergence of many positive changes and improvements in life and achieving promotion and an increase in livelihood soon. Seeing a sick friend is an expression of the dreamer’s fatigue and excessive exhaustion, and it may be an expression of the friend’s suffering and the need for the viewer to stand by his side. If you see in your dream that friends have turned into animals This is undesirable and portends the spread of hostility between them, while quarreling shows love and affection. Seeing friends saying goodbye is an expression of separation and distance in reality. As for a dream of betrayal by a friend, it expresses anxiety and psychological tension in the dreamer. It is a psychological vision. To dream That you shake hands with close friends indicates friendly and strong relationships and also expresses reconciliation between quarrels. Seeing an old friend in a dream according to Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin said that whoever sees an old friend placing his hand on the dreamer is a vision that indicates that he will betray him, but he will return to him and forgive him in the end. Vision Friends in the form of animals indicate the entry of enemies and the emergence of strife and disagreements between the fortuneteller and friends, which leads to a disturbance in the friendship between them. Seeing an old friend tired, exhausted and with a bad appearance means fatigue that will affect the dreamer, while seeing a friend wearing dark clothes means sadness, anxiety and loss. Seeing an old friend In a dream about single people, dream interpreters say about this vision that it indicates that she hears good news and that something important will happen in her life that will change her a lot. On the other hand, if an unmarried woman was previously restrained and sees the appearance of an old friend, this means that she will return to her first love Once again. Seeing a beloved friend is desirable and indicates the fulfillment of a desire and a valuable goal that the girl seeks. To dream of a friend suffering from distress or crying indicates that this person needs help, and the vision also expresses the girl’s suffering from worries. "
