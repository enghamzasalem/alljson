            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about a kiss on the cheek Seeing kisses or hugs in a dream is one of the visions that some may think that its interpretation takes a sexual turn at first and that most interpretations revolve around this context. On the contrary, we find that kissing in a dream is one of the visions that is interpreted for more than one person. This difference is due to the purpose of the kiss, as the kiss may be an expression of love or a compliment on an occasion or it is intended for falsification. Interpretation of a dream about kissing on the cheek in a dream The vision of a kiss on the cheek is interpreted according to what the dreamer has in himself during the vision. The kiss may be accompanied by sexual desire, then the interpretation is that the dreamer will marry the one he kisses, and if the one he kisses is not the person he actually means, then this is a deception, as in the dream world we do not control the course of its events, then we find people different from reality, and therefore what we see is a reflection and a different interpretation of the dream. If you dream that you are kissing a strange woman, this woman may be a reflection of a woman you know in reality and want to marry her. If the kiss does not have a sexual meaning, then the vision shows the practical relationships between the fortuneteller and others, so it is possible that he who is satisfied with God is in need, meaning that the fortuneteller must owe them, or desire interest or inquiry from him.
