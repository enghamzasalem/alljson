            "html": " Seeing a scorpion in a dream and killing it Seeing a scorpion in a dream and killing it is one of the most disturbing dreams for its owner, because of what is known about scorpions and their danger and the poison that resides in them and is transmitted to the person who is bitten by them. Seeing a scorpion in a dream and killing it The interpretation of the dream of a scorpion and killing it has been addressed by many dream interpretation scholars, who are not far from the general meaning of the dream, and here are some of their detailed phrases: If a person dreams of a scorpion sneaking away from a distance, this is evidence that the enemy is lurking around him and wants to harm him. But if he is actually bitten, he may suffer from a serious illness in the following period or need special care or fall into a calamity planned by some of his enemies. The presence of a scorpion on his way indicates many difficulties that prevent him from achieving the success he desires in his field of work or study. If the dreamer is able to eliminate it without being harmed, he will overcome the obstacles he finds in his life and will be able to reach his ambitions. Getting rid of it can also indicate overcoming a bitter enemy whom you do not like well and who is trying to destroy your life in various possible and impossible ways. As for escaping from it, it is a sign of the weakness of the dreamer’s personality and his inability to face the problems he faces and his constant need for support and support from others. The scorpion in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin is one of the great interpreters of dreams, and many ask for his opinion, and he said in seeing a scorpion In a dream: If you dream that there is a scorpion in your house, it is a friend who eats your food, drinks your drink, and sits with you for long hours in your house, and at the same time wishes you harm and never loves you. If a girl sees this scorpion approaching her and is ready to sting her, but she runs away from him, it is an evil person trying to lure her into sin in the name of false feelings, and her escape is evidence of her intelligence in that. His despicable purpose and her common sense that made her stay away from him. If the fortune teller carries a machine to kill the scorpion but was unable to do so in the end, this is a big problem or an annoying situation that he is involved in and its negative effects may continue in his life for some time. If you are quarreling with one of your relatives, take care of him as much as you can, seeing a scorpion indicates a great deception that you will fall into because of one of your relatives. A scorpion sting can indicate delving into symptoms, lying to people, and harming others. Ibn Sirin said: If the fortune teller finds a scorpion in his clothes, it is evidence of his wife’s betrayal, God forbid, and her morals are corrupt, but he must first of all make sure of that, as betrayal may come to him from him. A close relative without a wife. Scorpio in a dream by Ibn Sirin Seeing a scorpion in a dream for a single woman The presence of a scorpion in the dream of an unmarried girl is an important sign that must be taken into account in order to pass through the next stage without as many losses as possible. Seeing it lying under her bed or in her bedroom is evidence of some negative thoughts stuck in her mind now that may make her life hell. It also expresses her knowledge of a deceitful person who was able to deceive her with sweet words, and seeing it is evidence of her ability to uncover his intention to deceive her, and she must stay away from him immediately without ",
