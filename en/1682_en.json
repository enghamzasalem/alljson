And if a woman gives birth to a dragon in a dream, she will give birth to a tall boy, because the dragon crawls when he walks. And whoever dreams as if a dragon is dragging him through the water is torment. Power or torment from Almighty God or from his Lord harms him. If he sees that he has turned into a dragon, then his life will be long and he will gain power, and if he eats dragon meat, he will get money from the king. Perhaps the dragon has shown a long period of time because of its duration, so if he sees it coming towards him Without harm, or giving him something or speaking to him in a free language, this indicates a lot of good that will happen to him. Whoever sees in his dream a dragon changing, and a man from it, this indicates an army of jinn, three or four heads until it reaches seven heads, and each head brings misfortune and evil. If he becomes seven-headed, he will have no equal in his hatred and hostility. Whoever dreams that he is the king of a dragon, then he will win over a person without reason. If a pregnant woman sees that she has given birth to a dragon, then she will give birth to a son, or a glorious orator with a sharp tongue, or the son of a priest, or a soothsayer, or an evil sinner, or a thief. Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of the vision of the dragon. Although the dragon is a fictional and legendary creature, man has mentioned it for thousands of years, and therefore stories and legends have dealt with it since the era before Christ. Ibn Sirin mentioned this interpretation. Seeing in a dream. He said that seeing someone in his dream as if he were a dragon could indicate longevity or the power, influence, and prestige that he acquires. With his life, he hides and hides his hostility towards him, and the multi-headed dragon symbolizes a man of many tricks and many deceptions, and seeing a dragon in a dream blowing and extinguishing the fire is repulsive because it foretells misfortunes and wars, and it is repulsive to see it in the dream of a traveler or a sick person. Seeing a green dragon in a dream, in general, is considered the color Green in a dream is a sign of goodness and a call for optimism, even if one dreams of a wild or predatory animal, and seeing a green dragon in a person’s dream indicates that the dreamer controls negative feelings, emotions, and unlimited positive thinking. As for seeing a green dragon in a dream of an unmarried girl or woman, it is as if The green dragon attacks and chases her, this reflects the stage she is currently going through, a stage full of ambition. In revolution or anger in general, seeing a black dragon in a dream is unlike the color, seeing green in a dream, as the black color in dreams shows everything that is bad and also shows power and influence. A mule, hatred and envy of others, where the dreamer is the focus of the eyes of others because of his strength, influence, ambition, strength, beauty, wealth and money. The black dragon carries with it a grave danger. "
