Al-Nabulsi says in his book “Animal Smell in Interpretation of a Dream”: The market in a dream indicates the mosque, and the mosque in visions indicates the market and also indicates the war in which people win and lose. I swear. He called on the jihad of trade to God Almighty, saying: O you who have believed, I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful punishment (10) You believe in God and His Messenger and strive in the path of God with your wealth and your souls. This would be better for you if you knew (11) As for whoever sees in his dream that he is in an unknown market, he missed a sale or a purchase, and he was alert in jihad, then torment came upon him, but he left him escaping. Seeking or requesting collection. If he does not have any of these and he sees in a dream that he missed the market, then in his wakefulness he missed Friday prayers in the mosque. As for whoever sees in his dream that the market is crowded or full of people, or sees a fire inside, he will achieve profit and hypocrisy. From his family or acquaintances, it will not suit him. If the patrons of the market, its currency, or its merchants feel sleepy, and he sees his shops closed, or he sees that spiders have woven their webs and threads in its doors, then the market in this context indicates a depression. It was said in the interpretation: The market is the world, so whoever sees it Spacious and spacious, it strikes him as huge and powerful in his world. The market in a dream sometimes indicates turbulent circumstances, riots, and disputes due to which the common people gather. As for the one who sees in his dream that he lives or resides in the market, then this in the interpretation is good evidence. If the market is negative and there are no operations Purchasing or sales, this indicates in a dream unemployment, laziness or depression. Markets in a dream usually indicate benefits, interests and means of livelihood. Whoever sees himself entering them and sees in them what usually happens in markets of buying and selling and price negotiations, he may benefit from a benefit such as clothing or... Housing. If the market is in a cheap place or place, then in the dream it means immorality, vulgarity, and perhaps suffering and anxiety. Buying in a dream indicates any gathering place such as a mosque, school, university, and church. Perhaps the markets show the sea containing different types of fish and whales eating each other. Buying in a dream also indicates striving for the world and seeking pleasures and desires in it, and can benefit from falling into taboos or inclination to falsehood. If the dreamer dreams that he enters the market, or He remembers God, or glorifies Him, for in this world he is among those who forbid evil and enjoin truth and good. Al-Nabulsi says: Every purchase has an expression. "
