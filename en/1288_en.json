What does fighting mean in a dream?

            "html": " Donate blood in a dream Many interpretations are combined to see donating blood in a dream, but the dreamer's great sacrifice appears according to the other person, and this is if he knows him in reality, but the meaning differs if you donate blood to someone you do not know, and we explain many details about this vision throughout our article. Donate blood in a dream by Ibn Sirin Donate blood in a dream The interpretation of the dream of donating blood shows many meanings depending on the circumstances and social status of the person, as well as whether he knows the other person or not. Knowing that the girl is a blood donor means that she is facing a big problem in her job that can lead to her loss and loss, as the search for another new and more stable job begins. The person may be suffering from some financial crises and needs help from those around him in seeing this dream and may be distracted by the difficulty of his life in front of him and his constant stumbling and his inability to achieve a specific dream he is looking for. If you donate blood to save someone you know, the dream means your strong love for that person and your constant help and assistance to him in everything he needs. If the dreamer himself is the one who needs it, he is in a certain crisis and is going through difficult financial circumstances in which he hopes for the help of those around him or even their emotional support. Donating blood in a dream by Ibn Sirin The interpretation of the dream of donating blood according to Ibn Sirin explains that the dreamer who donates it to someone depends on the interpretation of the extent of his knowledge of the other, because this vision indicates one of the losses that the dreamer generally falls into. But donating blood to someone known to the dreamer, such as a mother, brother, or others, is an indication of his good relationship with this person, his clear love for him, and his desire to offer anything that pleases him. If you see in your dream that you are sick and need someone's help to provide you with blood, then in reality you are going through some crises in your life, perhaps related to financial resources and you need to borrow money from someone. Ibn Sirin suggests that when the dreamer sees this dream, he loses his livelihood and work, and gets involved in some debts that multiply in distress and sadness in his life, and God knows best. Why didn't you find an interpretation for your dream? Go to Google and search for the Egyptian dream interpretation site. Donating blood in a dream for an unmarried woman The interpretation of a dream about donating blood for a single woman explains some of the difficulties that the girl faces as a result of her separation from her job and the need to search for a new job that she can rely on in the next stage. If the blood donation is to her fiancé in the vision, this indicates the sincerity of their relationship between them and her great closeness to him, and she has given him a lot to make him happy and reassure him.
