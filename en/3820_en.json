Interpretation of a dream about a dream about marriage by al-Nabulsi: Marriage in a dream shows the providence of God Almighty and perhaps Marriage signifies families, religion, anxiety and sadness. Marriage, according to custom, is a position or good, and fame and marriage express an art. Whoever sees that he married a woman and then died, then he works in a craft that brings nothing but work, toil, and anxiety. A Christian woman, she strives in an art in which there is a lie, and if she is a Zoroastrian, then it is an art without religion. He gets the money if he is worthy of it, otherwise he assumes guardianship, and whoever marries a dead person to earn a dead person will despair of it. Selling real estate, and if a pregnant woman sees that she is married, she will give birth to a slave girl, and if she sees a bride, she will give birth to a son, and if she sees a woman, she will give birth to a son. She got married and then married her son. He marries a woman and has a wife or wives. He is influenced by choice and power according to the beauty and appearance of the woman. If he sees it and recognizes it, and if he does not see it, he recognizes it and prepares for it, then this is evidence of his death or the death of a person at his hands. he do not know ; Because it is of great benefit, and if she becomes ill, she will be cured, and whoever sees that he has married a dead woman to one of his mahrams, he will be bound to her kinship, and if she is alive, he will sever her kinship ties. And everything that the earth indicates comfort, fatigue, good and evil, is attributed to the wife in this way, as it indicates to her. Interpretation of a dream about marriage by Ibn Shaheen: Whoever dreams of marrying a woman and marrying her or something similar is affected by the strength, goodness, and beauty of the woman if he sees her. Or he knows her, and if he does not know her or see her, nor his name and she is unknown, then this indicates his death or the death of one of them at his hands as well, so if he sees a groom but does not see his wife. He does not know her, and this is indicated by the Qur’an and the evidence. Whoever dreams of marrying a sheikh or his sister will achieve a lot of good, and so will the woman who dreams of marriage of this type. He marries a dead woman and completes her consummation, then acquires the status of a dead woman by circumcising her. If he does not associate with her or deceive her, his victory in the matter is not proven. She is in her money, her affairs are divided, her condition has changed, and if the deceased allows her to enter his house while she is unknown, then she will die. If he dies, he attempts something that only bothers him, and if he sees that the woman he married is Jewish, then he will come to the profession in which he will commit immorality, and if she is Christian, then this is an order. False profession (and adultery only marries an adulterer) A woman is a strong woman, and his dream indicates that he was killed, and whoever sees that he married a woman to another man and took her to him, his honor and his livelihood, and whoever dreams that he marries a woman and deceives her, this indicates his dignity and possession of what was not his. He saw that he was marrying an animal, whatever its type, this indicates that he was marrying a woman related to that animal. Otherwise, ignore it.
