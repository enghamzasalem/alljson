For them and use things to his advantage. As for seeing the sun as if its rays are dim or that the sun is hiding behind clouds and clouds in a dream, this reflects the life that the viewer lives, full of sadness and worries. The dream is an indication of ambition and the desire to reach the desired goal and work to achieve goals, after a period of feeling lost and scattered. The dream of the sun is usually associated with success, energy, warmth and creative vitality. As for sunlight, it evokes ideas of luxury and comfort, but in dreams, the vision of the sun differs from one person to another. In your dream, you may see the sun covered with clouds or the sun falling from the sky, so we must interpret all these visions with the correct interpretation. Seeing the sun in your dream means freedom and prosperity. If the sun is dark in the dream, this is good, as it indicates earning money or acquiring some new property. As for seeing the sun falling on the water, it is evidence of longevity. If you dream of seeing the bright sunrise, this portends happy events, joys, prosperity and a bright future. If you see the sun at noon, this indicates the maturity of your ambitions that will soon be achieved and the peace and satisfaction that you will feel. If you see the sunset, your joys and wealth will be at their best. You have to take care of your interests and be careful.

If you see the sun in an eclipse, know that difficult and dangerous times await you, but you will overcome them and your family and professional conditions will become better than they were. Abu Saeed Al-Waiz said: Whoever sees the sun rotating in the sky while looking at it, it is evidence for the king of his opinion. Whoever dreams that he took the sun in his hand, but it is not from the sky, nor light nor ray, and it was not dark, he will rest from the clouds, even if it is dark and not in the place where the sultan needs the fortune teller in any matter. Ismail bin Al-Ash’ath said: “Whoever sees the sun speaking to him will receive honor and glory from the sultan.” And whoever sees that he prostrated to the sun shows his sin. And whoever dreams that the sun has risen from the earth and is shining as it is, if he is sick, this indicates his recovery, and if he is absent, this means that he will return safely. And whoever sees the sun on the ground and has no light, it shows the isolation of the king of that place. And whoever sees the sun in a dungeon and sets in it indicates the death of the sultan ",
