Interpretation of seeing the eye in a dream by Ibn Sirin The following are the clearest indications of seeing the eye in the various cases of this sight, as mentioned by the scholar Ibn Sirin: It indicates the wisdom and insight that God Almighty has bestowed upon him. The dreamer: The presence of fog over the dreamer’s eyes in a dream that prevents him from seeing things clearly symbolizes the presence of something that worries him and occupies his thoughts, and he is unable to decide or move on from it. This dream may also indicate his inability to see the truth and distinguish it from falsehood, according to the Almighty’s words in Surat Yasin, verse 9 (So We covered them so that they would not see).

Interpretation of a dream about an injured eye. Cases vary. Seeing an eye injury in a dream ranges from a simple scratch to complete manipulation and perforation, which is what we will explain the importance of the vision in the following points: Having a scratch in the eye indicates exposure to a problem or a heated discussion with a person dear to the viewer, but this dispute will soon end with the grace of God Almighty. While the blood that comes out of the eye and its bleeding indicates sin and disobedience, this vision warns the dreamer of the need for urgent repentance. Complete blindness and lack of vision indicate exposure to betrayal by a person whom the fortuneteller trusts and who cannot discover this betrayal. Seeing the eye in a single woman’s dream: A wound to a woman’s eye is not A married woman in a dream when she is engaged or about to be engaged symbolizes that she is facing some problems in her engagement, while bleeding from the eyes is a sign of the end of this engagement, which saddens her heart, by God.
