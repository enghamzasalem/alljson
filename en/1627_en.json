There is no Muslim on this earth who does not wish to perform the rituals of Hajj and Umrah in order to respond to the call of God Almighty for him. It is one of the most precious wishes that every Muslim wants to fulfill, and many see in his vision that he is going to the Sacred House of God. We are talking about a person who wants to achieve it on the ground or it is a real vision, so the scholar Ibn Sirin wanted to provide local interpretations of these visions and clarify what they mean, and through the following lines in the encyclopedia we will explain the interpretation of Ihram in a dream for different occasions.Interpretation of Ihram in a dreamInterpretation of Ibn Sirin in Seeing Ihram in a dream: The scholar Ibn Sirin says: Ihram in a dream during its seasons is a good omen for the pioneer of acquiring livelihood and abundant good things, his recovery from illness, and his marriage if he is single. But if a woman sees in her dream that she is wearing the Ihram dress, this indicates her separation if she is married. Whoever sees In his dream that he is forbidden in anything other than Hajj or Umrah, his dream indicates that he is committing many sins that make God Almighty angry with him. Dreaming about entering ihram naked or with a black face is evidence that the dreamer is committing sins and disobedience. Interpretation of seeing an unmarried woman entering ihram in a dream: Seeing ihram In the dream of an unmarried woman, it symbolizes her bad psychological state and a difficult period that she can overcome. Whoever sees in her dream that she is prevented from performing Umrah, then her dream indicates her closeness to God, and the enjoyment of religiosity and high morals. Wearing white ihram clothes in the dream of an unmarried woman indicates However, God Almighty will accept her repentance for the sins she committed, and that she insists on God’s obligations towards her. This dream may indicate the dreamer’s marriage to a person with good morals with whom she will be happy. Wearing the Ihram in a dream for a married womanIf a married woman sees in her dream that she is wearing the Ihram, Her dream indicates that she will enjoy stability and happiness with her husband and in her life. Seeing ihram in a married woman’s dream indicates that she is a woman who enjoys justice and piety and treats her husband in a way that pleases his Lord. This dream may indicate the mother’s imminent pregnancy and an increase in the number of her children. A wife’s ihram with her husband in a dream It indicates the intensity of her husband’s love for her. Interpretation of a dream about a man wearing ihram: If a man dreams that he is wearing black ihram clothes, then his dream indicates that he has committed sin and misdeeds. As for someone who sees in his dream that he is wearing white ihram clothes, this means that the dreamer is close to God Almighty. The dream of wearing ihram for a deceased person in a man’s dream symbolizes that God will accept the work of this deceased and put him in a state of righteousness. One of the auspicious dreams for a man is his dream of wearing ihram clothes to perform Hajj rituals. A man’s dream of buying ihram clothes is a praiseworthy dream, because it means that his debts will soon be paid and his problems and worries will disappear. If an unmarried person sees in his dream that it is forbidden, this means that he will marry a woman distinguished by justice and beauty, and he will be happy with her. A dream about wearing ihram clothes in a traveler’s dream indicates that God will save him from evil. "
