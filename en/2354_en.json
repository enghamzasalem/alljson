            "html": " The meaning of the Virgin Mary for the single, married, pregnant, and divorced girl, the single and married young man, and more according to Ibn Sirin. Interpretation of the vision of the Virgin by Ibn Sirin. The vision of the Virgin Mary, Maryam bint Imran, peace be upon her, the mother of our Lord Jesus, the miracle worker. God honored the Virgin Mary, peace be upon her, and dedicated a surah to her in the Qur’an, which is the surah of Mary, that lady. The pure, pure, pious woman whom God said to her in Surah Al-Imran: “The angels said, ‘O Mary, God has chosen you, purified you, and chosen you above the women of the worlds.’” Verse 42 This is a great personality whose presence in a dream cannot be merely good and bad news. If Mary, peace be upon her, saw a pregnant woman, then this It indicates that she will give birth to a son, and he will be wise, God willing. A woman who sees the Lady, peace be upon her, in a dream shows her purity, integrity, nobility, and excellence. Seeing the Virgin Mary in a dream indicates relief from anxiety, which makes things easier and fulfills needs. For a pregnant woman, seeing The Virgin Mary in a dream means: that the newborn, whether male or female, is related by blood and is just and respected without being one of his peers. As for the oppressed woman, the appearance of the Virgin Mary in her dream is a sign: of her innocence and of revealing the truth, especially if she is accused in her honor. The interpretation of seeing the Virgin Mary in The dream, pure and pure, according to the interpretation of the scholar Ibn Sirin, confirms that the sight of this pure name indicates the purity and chastity of the dreamer who sees this pure and discreet vision. That the girl is pure and a sign of her purity and distance from Satan. Seeing the Virgin Mary in a dream indicates that the dreamer maintains many acts of worship and devotion. Interpretation of seeing the Virgin in a dream When a dreamer comes from a man or woman in a dream, seeing the Virgin Mary, he will rise in status and honor among the people Because he will get everything he wants from the world's needs and live in abundance and goodness. Whoever sees himself worshiping Mary in a dream addresses the king with a request for his affairs and receives it or sits with him, but it is said that worshiping Mary is in the case of worshiping another person. From God, it is a shameful act or a sin on the part of the dreamer, and he must ask forgiveness for him and repent or correct what he did. As for the pregnant woman, whoever was pregnant in the first part of her pregnancy and saw the virgin, then she is carrying in her womb a child who will have wisdom in his worldly life just as the virgin carried. Who was carrying a girl in her womb and saw the Virgin Mary, whether it was a request to name her daughter Mary, or she would give birth to a daughter who would be pious and righteous in herself and her children. An unmarried girl’s vision of Lady Mary is that she will get what she wants in her life, in contrast to the things that are written and confirmed, such as Marriage, because it is inevitable and predetermined. Seeing the Virgin Mary in a single woman’s dream.
