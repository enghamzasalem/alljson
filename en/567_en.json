            "html": " The dream of divorce is for a single girl, a married woman, a pregnant woman, a divorced woman, or a triple woman. Interpretation of divorce in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin narrated that a man who divorces his wife in a dream foretells wealth and poverty if the divorce is non-violent, and a interactive divorce foretells separation and abandonment of work, and a violent divorce foretells the loss of money. Or fanaticism, because {women. In a man’s dream, it indicates money or work. For a man to dream of divorcing his wife while she is sick, in reality it portends her death, if it is a revocable divorce, but if it is a final divorce, it is better and safer for the wife and children. A sick man’s divorce from his wife foretells his death, poverty, ruin, or sadness. God forbid, divorce in a dream symbolizes poverty, loss, and the end of relationships. It can also mean losing a strong bond of friendship. However, some dream interpreters believe that divorcing a person in a dream is confirmation that the latter will be sufficient, based on one of the verses of the Holy Quran. For Muslims, there are three degrees of divorce, with each man having the right to divorce each wife only three times. In some cases, a man may use the phrase “I broke you with three.” In this regard, the meaning of the dream can be reversed or resolved depending on the seriousness of the situation. If a sick and married man dreams that he divorces his wife three times, this means that his lifestyle will change and things will not return to what they were before, considering that the woman is the crown of the man and the focus of his entire life. As for If a person dreams that he is divorcing his only wife, this means that he will lose his honor and authority for a temporary or permanent period, depending on the degree of divorce. The same dream can be interpreted that the person in question will argue with another person or quarrel with his closest friends. A single person’s dream of divorce symbolizes that his condition will change for the better or for the worse. It may also symbolize the time of his approaching death. As for a married man’s dream of divorce, it indicates either the possibility of losing his job (in case he loves his wife) or the possibility of achieving his desires in life (in case he does not love her). Whoever sees in his dream that he is divorcing his wife while he is still single, this indicates that he is bidding farewell to his life. Single and thus preparing for marriage. Her divorce is considered a good and promising sign of marriage or engagement. Interpretation of divorce in a dream in Nabulsi. Nabulsi believes that the interpretation of a dream of divorce in a dream for a single, unmarried person is that this person will radically change his life to what it is, but if a married person dreams of a sick person. That is, this person will change his life and become alone, but he may continue to live, or this person may die, especially because he is sick.
