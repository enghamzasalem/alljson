The aunt’s house, and the aunt is sad, crying, laughing or dead, or the aunt is dead or sick, and the meaning of kissing the aunt according to Ibn Sirin and more on the topic. Interpretation of seeing the father’s sister’s aunt in a dream: Is the aunt the father’s sister or is she another image of him drawn in our hearts? We love our aunts because they are our fathers' sisters, so aunt love comes from father love, but does every man also love his aunt in wakefulness? Surely there are those who do not have an intimate relationship with him, but they see it in their dreams, so it does not make sense to analyze their dreams according to feelings or emotions. There is another basic factor that makes us see aunt in a dream, which is the symbol that comes from the word. My reader friend noticed that the word aunt comes from the word aunt, meaning hesitation, confusion, and lack of clarity of vision according to what was entered in the Book of Meanings to interpret and interpret profanity. A person’s aunt in a dream is a palm tree. If he does not have palm trees, then he is from his clan, like his uncle and father. His aunt may be his blessing or his turban, taken from the word, and this is the origin. If we stop at the pronunciation, then the aunt in the dream will not have a positive interpretation like the one we saw a while ago. But the name of the aunt can change the direction of interpretation to shift from its negative meaning in reference to hesitation and confusion to a positive meaning indicated by a name such as (Mabrouka, Zeinat, Bushra, Joy, Firdaus...). The aunt who appeared in the dream could be overweight or obese and this is of course a positive symbol and shows you a world coming towards you full of new and good things. The vision is green because it is one of the symbols of heaven. As for the charming or scandalous aunt, she does not deserve praise in the dream, and symbolizes misguidance and distraction. Seeing my aunt in a dream, this vision indicates that its owner has overcome the difficult stage he has been experiencing for a long time, and the dreamer will try hard to make his work go well. At the same time, seeing an aunt in a dream means that you will earn a lot of money, you will enter into a big business and you will not face any problems and you will do what is necessary for your working life and thanks to the steps you will take you will get big profits. Interpretation of a sick aunt in a dreamThe person who sees this vision will not face Any illness and he will live a comfortable and happy life, and the one who has the vision, thanks to some deeds that he will achieve, will live a decent life and live a life full of comfort if his life continues in this way and he will stay away from problems. Whoever sees this vision will, God willing, get rid of the problems he faces in practical life, and thanks to The help he will get from one of the people he loves will mean that you will enter a job that will make you earn a lot of money. Interpretation of a dead aunt in a dream: Seeing the aunt died in a dream. This vision indicates that you will live with great difficulties and that your work will take a turn for the worse, but the dreamer will get rid of problems and gain comfort in his professional life. And solve his problems ",
