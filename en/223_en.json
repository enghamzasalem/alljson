All the surahs of the Holy Qur’an contain many rulings and messages that God Almighty wants or conveys to His servants, and among the surahs that bring many miracles and knowledge and explain many concepts about the world of the jinn to people are the surahs of the jinn that descended upon the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, in Mecca, so In this article, we will learn together about the reason for the revelation of Surat Al-Jinn, the explanation, and the explanation. Virtues and their purposes. The reason for the revelation of Surah Al-Jinn in the Holy Qur’an. Surah Al-Jinn is one of the Meccan surahs that was revealed to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, while he was in Mecca and called on the people of Quraysh to convert to Islam before he went to Medina. Inside the surah are twenty-eight verses from the Qur’an. God revealed Surah Al-Jinn to tell us what they did to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, while he went to Souk Ukaz to introduce the people of Mecca to Islam and abandon paganism and faith. There is no god but Him. After that, the Prophet went with his companions to perform the dawn prayer in a valley near Mecca called Wadi Al-Jinn, and at that time many jinn heard our honorable Messenger reciting some verses of the Qur’an. Then the jinn went to their families to do what they heard about words that no one had heard before. Because of these verses, the jinn believed in God and His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and then returned to their tribe to invite them to embrace Islam. Explanation of Surah Al-Jinn in the Qur’anIn this section we discuss the explanation of the verses of Surah The jinn and the interpretation of the verses from verse number one to verse five, and we mention the interpretations of religious scholars in detail in the following: The verses tell us about the reason for the revelation of Surat Al-Jinn and what happened to the tribe of Satan when they learned that he was misleading them and lying to them, and because they heard about a messenger who had entered Islam. “Say, ‘It was revealed to me that a group They heard from the jinn and said, “We have heard a wondrous Qur’an.” As for the second verse of Surat Al-Jinn: It leads to righteousness, so we believe in it and do not associate with our Lord. He explained it: that the jinn know the path of the jinn and the truth, and that they worship God alone. The scholars have interpreted the fourth verse of Surat Al-Jinn, which contains the text: “He is the grandfather of our Lord. He did not take a partner or a friend.” He did not have God and will never have a son or family. The fifth verse of the surah explained that Satan lied to his people and was the reason for their misguidance and distance from God. What are the purposes of Surah Al-Jinn?

After that, the Prophet went with his companions to perform the dawn prayer in a valley near Mecca called the Valley of the Jinn, and at that time many of the Jinn heard our noble Messenger reciting some verses of the Qur’an. Then the Jinn went to their families to do what they heard about words that no one had heard before.

He has not taken a partner or a friend.” He did not have a son or a family with God Almighty. The fifth verse of the surah explained that Satan lied to his people and was the reason for their misguidance and distancing them from God. What are the purposes of Surat Al-Jinn?

Then they enter into the religion of Allah and His Oneness.
