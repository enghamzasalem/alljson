The interpretation of drinking alcohol in a dream is based on the Almighty’s saying: (They ask you about wine and gambling, so tell them that for people there is a great sin and a benefit. And their sin is greater than the benefit.) Money is permissible, forbidden, or suspicious. Drinking alcohol in a dream indicates worry and sorrow, and drunkenness is eternal wealth along with arrogance. Interpretation of one who drinks alcohol in a dream: Ibn Sirin said regarding drinking alcohol: Whoever drinks alcohol in his sleep and there is no one to take it from him or oppose it. In his drinking, he is influenced by illicit money, and some disagreed regarding its permissibility, and if someone comes in the dream and fights with him while he is drinking alcohol, then this person, if he knows him, argues with him in talking and fighting as long as we ask him in the dream or he argues with him. He has something beyond money. But if he dreams that he drinks juice or squeezes it, then the juice indicates the fertility of the one who drinks it and takes it, but if he squeezes it, then he becomes, in one way or another, a servant of the Sultan. If he sees in a dream that he is getting drunk without drinking wine, then anxiety, sadness, fear, and terror will occur. He has to decide. If he dreams that the wine is foam, then he is the owner of money who will fall behind on his money or increase his money on the butter, and if it is sour, then he is sick, and if he sees that his house is empty. And it was broken, then he divorced his wife. But seeing the tank in general is to obtain treasure, and if you see love in the jar and it is in a house, it shows a rich and troubled woman in that house, and if the love of water is for drinking, then this indicates a man who has a lot of money, a great expense to God. And charity and good deeds. Whoever dreams that he is among a large group drinking alcohol, the interpretation of that is not good, because drinking a lot of alcohol, then getting drunk in the dream, is a struggle, quarrel, and opposition. And whoever sees that he shaved his head and drank alcohol, he will win a wife or get married, and it is said in An old story is that a man came to an interpreter or translator in a dream and told him the content of the dream (as if he dreamed of his black face, shaving his head, and drinking alcohol), so he interpreted the passage as meaning that his face would be black, he would judge his people, he would shave his head, and he would leave your people. You and you will leave you, and this is that you were in the command of the sovereignty of the people, and as for drinking wine, you will take a wife. And when he sees the ruler or whoever conquers his people drinking wine or carrying a vessel of wine in his hand, then he will leave or his kingdom will pass over the people. Ibn Sirin said that milk is fairer to you than your people, but as for alcohol and wine, it was removed from your place, and in fact it was removed after a short time. In the story of another man who owned the state, he was riding in a dream with a company of his people, and when he came to him to go, he found them all drunk. And he couldn't control any of them. And they remained drunk, so Ibn Shirin explained that his people abandoned him and expelled him and did not respond to his orders and did not follow him.
