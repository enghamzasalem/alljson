He violates it without shame or fear of undermining the values ​​of society and corrupting it. Money, various loots, real estate, gems, gems, and other properties are among the most clear indicators that you are dreaming of rams, whether for a man or a woman. The interpretation of a dream about seeing a big ram for a pregnant woman means that after giving birth, she will find goodness before her And a stock at its disposal, especially if it sees that this large ram will be slaughtered for preparation. Aqeeqah for her son in a dream. Al-Nabulsi confirmed that a slaughtered ram in a dream means the death of a person of great authority and status. If the dreamer cuts off the head of the Shah with the intention of sacrificing him at the Eid, this means that the torment will go away, and here torment means many things. Lack of work and unemployment for unmarried or unmarried people, or anxiety and distress for one of the dreamer’s relatives, which causes a crisis in the dreamer and his feeling of sadness, but the dream confirmed that God will help him get out of it. Ibn Sirin said that a ram or sheep in the dreamer’s dream may indicate that God will give him a son. He does what the Most Merciful mentioned in his book regarding obedience to parents and alleviating their pain.

They did nothing to deserve death without mercy or pity. If the dreamer dreams that he did not slaughter the ram until guests came to him in the dream and he wanted to host them and feed them as God and His Messenger commanded us, then this is evidence of the dreamer’s remorse for the indecency and prohibition. He does the deeds, then he asks for forgiveness and seeks refuge with God to forgive him and accept his repentance. If the dreamer in a dream takes the horns of a sheep or a ram, then this dream means that God will grant him great power, whether it is the power of money and health or control and influence. If the dreamer drinks sheep’s milk in his dream, then This vision means that he will soon feel satisfied with money and a lot of food. If the dreamer dreams of a fat ram, the interpretation of the vision is better than seeing a thin or sick ram, because a fat ram is money, and a thin ram is hardship and tight circumstances. To dream of a woman with the ram’s horns means that she A woman who maintains her dignity and does not allow anyone to harm her body because she is pure and always follows the word of God.
