            "html": " Premenstrual breast swelling, or cyclic atrophy, is a common concern among women. The symptoms are part of a group of symptoms called premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual breast swelling and tenderness can be a sign of fibrocystic breast disease. Fibrocystic breast disease is a term used to describe painful, lumpy breasts before menstruation. Women with this condition often notice large, benign (noncancerous) lumps in their breasts before their period. These lumps may move when pressed and usually shrink once your period ends. What causes premenstrual breast pain? What causes premenstrual mastitis? According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), hormonal changes due to menstruation are the cause of breast pain Before menstruation. Low levels of estrogen and progesterone before menstruation can lead to mastitis. These changes can also cause the lymph node to become enlarged, which may also contribute to breast pain. There may also be a link between breast pain and a hormone called prolactin. This hormone stimulates the production of breast milk in women after childbirth.

Breast tenderness can also occur around the time of ovulation, when the ovary releases an egg for possible fertilization. This is usually done 12 to 14 days before your period is due. Some women report pain in only one breast. If hormones are the only underlying cause, some doctors believe that both breasts will respond the same way. Therefore, other changes in the body may be the cause of breast tenderness before menstruation. Another explanation is that the cells in each breast respond differently to fluctuating hormone levels. What causes premenstrual mastitis? Symptoms Chest pain can vary from person to person. Some people describe pain as pain, while others define it as pain or tenderness. Chest pain can be: Dull It occurs in one or both breasts Radiates into the armpit Feeling lonely sometimes Occurs with swelling A denser sensation in the nipple area Some people experience pain that lasts several days, while others find that it comes and goes.
