The topic of our article deals with the interpretation of seeing coal in a dream according to what was mentioned in the book of dream interpretation by the great interpreter Muhammad bin Sirin. Where we discover together the set of signs that coal, ash and cannon symbolize in the vision. Coal was mentioned in the famous book “The Great Interpretation of Dreams” in the forty-second chapter under the title “In the vision of fire and its tools from curtains, wood, coal, ovens, candles, lamps, candles, lanterns and what? Related to this.” Interpretation of seeing coal in a dream Ibn Sirin says: Coal is from trees, and in the interpretation it is a dangerous man, and he adds: Coal is forbidden money, and it is a provision from the Lord. Unused coal is similar to ash, so it is reprehensible, false, or hated. As for the coal used for fuel, it indicates the multiplicity of voices for a person in his work because of the benefit in it. It is said that Saif bin Di Yazan (516 AD - 574 AD) saw in his sleep a fire descending from the sky over the land of Aden, and it fell on each of its houses, and it went out until it became coal. . . When he narrated that vision by crossing his kingdom, they answered him: Abyssinia occupies his land and his kingdom, so it happened after a while. Ashes in a dream It was mentioned in Ibn Sirin's interpretation that ash is forbidden, and in the interpretation it is a suspicious livelihood that the dreamer takes from the ruler, and he is tired as a result of that from the sultan and his entourage. It was also said: Ashes are useless knowledge, or that it is a false statement and slander. Whoever sees in his dream as if he is lighting an oven or lighting a fire in his house, he will benefit from his money or his children. Ibn Sirin says in the interpretation of ash: Whoever strikes a furnace without ash marries a woman who is not suitable for it. Kanun in a dream As for the iron base in a dream, it expresses the noble and noble woman with strength, skill, money and judgment. If the base is made of wood, it indicates hypocrisy, flattery and evasion by the dreamer's people. The gypsum base indicates the greatness of lineage, and the clay or the vessel indicates piety, obedience and dignity of the wife and children. The base that appears in the dream containing fire indicates strength and influence, and expresses the state, emirate, rule, prestige and authority. The base that appears in the dream without fire indicates failure, defeat, unemployment and indicates poverty, need and distress. ",
