The good news is the good dream that a Muslim sees or sees about him, as stated in the authentic hadith. What makes a Muslim happy and happy is seeing a vision that bodes well - each according to his needs in his life - the patient searches for well-being and how happy he is when he sees a vision that indicates his recovery, and a single woman rejoices in Visions. A harbinger of marriage in a dream. Everyone who is in debt or suffering and surrounded by problems from all sides expects a vision that shows relief. Interpreting dreams and visions is not an easy task because this area is full of secrets and knowledge that some may reach through study, research, and studying books of the past, and others may reach To him through spiritual selection, inspiration and reception. If we go to Ibn Sirin or Al-Nabulsi, we find that each of them has engaged in study, and the study here is directed towards human nature and external knowledge. Studying the nature of man whose vision is to be interpreted is the key through which we can reveal the hidden mystery, and knowledge of the era and its sciences is necessary to examine it. Because what exists in one era may change in another era. Camels were the means of travel, but now cars, trains and planes, then we find a person going through the process of analogy in the interpretation of a dream, where the interpretation of sentences can be compared to the interpretation of a car in one way or another. As we mentioned above, the biggest factor in the accurate interpretation of a vision lies in the knowledge of human nature, and the awareness within it and its phenomena, And familiarity with its words and actions.

From this part it becomes clear to us that interpretation or explanation according to different terminology can have more than one meaning and significance when we realize the nature of God, His nature, His attributes, and the extent of His justice from His corruption. And if the interpretation is based on study and research, then we find, on the other hand, that there are those who have ideas, and are raised to the position they reached through choice, and let us give an example of this: If we look at the biography of the Prophet Joseph (may God bless him and grant him peace) We find that he is an ascetic committed to the teachings of God, and God has given him the ability to interpret without giving him the possibility of prior study. This is a kind of divine appearance. O fellow captives, one of you will give his Lord something to drink, and for the sake of the other he will be crucified while the birds eat his head. What is observed here is the absolute certainty of the translator. There is no doubt that what he announced will inevitably happen, and perhaps this is what distinguishes between the Prophet and the saints of God and between researchers and scholars. From this point it becomes clear to us that science can be profitable, we obtain it from experiences, knowledge and experiments and we learn it from life forms. Knowledge can be innate, coming from within and developing spontaneously or through practice, reflection and strong faith. Just like the seeker who leans with all his heart toward Him ",
