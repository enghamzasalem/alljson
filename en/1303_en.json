            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about the news of the death of a living person Hearing the news of the death of a person is one of the worst news that can come to a person in reality, which calls for sadness and depression as well if seen in a dream, especially if this news is about a loved one in the vision, and today we will learn about the implications of this vision from his point of view: Interpretation of visions and dreams. Interpretation of a dream about the news of the death of a living person Hearing the news of the death of a living person in a dream can have many positive connotations, contrary to what the viewer believes. Related to a wedding or engagement in the very near future. If a man sees in a dream that someone he knows has died while hearing the news of his death, he hears happy news about him that indicates a promotion that this person has received or a large profit that he has obtained from a successful business in reality. Seeing a person in his dream that he was wearing black clothes on the deceased in his dream means that he is suffering from sorrows and distress and will suffer from many problems in his life, and if he is in an important position in his work, this is a sign of troubles at work, which led to him losing his position. As for the married woman, if she sees this vision, it carries the opposite of what it liberates, as it indicates that this person will have a long life. If the person who heard the news of his death is the husband, her dream means that she will enjoy complete health and well-being if she is not suffering from any disease in reality. However, if the husband is sick, the vision may indicate the seriousness of the disease on him, and in this case he must be given the necessary care and attention and follow the doctor's instructions carefully so that the reason for his recovery is soon. If a married woman sees that her husband has died, she loves him very much and considers him a husband, father and supporter in life and never fails to take care of him and his health as well as her care for her children and her home in general. The vision can have other meanings than death. It may indicate a change in the life of the seer and a difference in the approach and method he follows in his life. If the husband dies in reality and the wife sees that she heard the news of his death again in her dream, this is good news that will come to her soon, and it may be the news of someone who has been missing for a long time and will return soon. As for if the seer sees that he has died and is wrapped, this is a sign of his weakness in the right of God (Glory be to Him) upon him and his failure to perform the tasks and duties that God has. He advised us, and in this case he must review himself and get rid of these sins and follow the path of truth and guidance until he reaches the satisfaction of the Creator. If you have a dream and do not find its interpretation, go to Google and type an Egyptian site for interpreting dreams. Interpretation of a vision about the news of the death of a living person by Ibn Sirin. The scholar Ibn Sirin said that whoever hears in a dream about the death of a relative of his is evidence of his recovery from illness if he is sick, and relief from his sorrows if he is sad or faces a certain problem in reality. He also said that a man seeing this vision is evidence of the partnership between him and that person and that the partnership will succeed and achieve many profits in the future. As for seeing the father while he is alive that he died in the dreamer's dream and he heard the news of his death, this is a sign of many good things ",
