Or are there other interpretations of this dream? We will learn this through the interpretations of our distinguished scholars. Tooth falling out in a dream by Ibn Sirin Tooth falling out in a dream If the dreamer's tooth falls out, it leads him to do some wrong things that lead him to the forbidden, and makes him in a great sin, so he must stay away from those methods that make him suffer and distress in this world and so on. If the dreamer sees that he pulled out his tooth while he was asleep, but he felt the same feeling even after waking up, this does not portend evil, but rather it is evidence that his Lord has enlightened his insight and made him know his insight. Enemies until he moves away from them and is unable to harm him, and the vision also expresses getting rid of all problems and worries without return. The tooth falling out after its movement is not a commendable sign, but rather indicates that the dreamer is exposed to fatigue that continues for a period, but he must always call on his Lord to save him from any harm that may befall him or disappear. Through him. What is in his life. Losing a tooth indicates anxiety, fear and weakness, as the vision leads to some problems for which the dreamer does not find radical solutions, and this makes him suffer psychologically, and he remains in this evil for a short period. Until he gets rid of it. The tooth falling out in Ibn Sirin's dream Our greatest imam Ibn Sirin explains to us that the tooth falling out does not carry a single sign, but there are many places that make seeing it good news for the dreamer, and there are other places that make it bad. And safety, but if these teeth fall out completely and he does not find them around him, this leads to his exhaustion and goes through a period of bad health. If the dreamer's teeth are completely uneven, this indicates the presence of enmity and competition with a relative, and he must end it immediately. There is no doubt that severing kinship ties is one of the most dangerous things that angers God Almighty and turns a person into a pure sin, so he must avoid this sin and maintain his prayers as soon as possible. If the dreamer's teeth fall from his tongue, he must beware of every word or saying that comes out of him, because it causes a lot of trouble due to his hurtful words, so he must change his ways, and beware of every word that comes. From his mouth. The falling or extraction of a tooth without wound or pain for the dreamer expresses his liberation from all his worries and judgments. His innocence and his release from his prison in a good way. The Egyptian website is the largest website specialized in interpreting dreams in the Arab world.
