Sheikh Ibn Sirin, may God have mercy on him, narrated about the interpretation of seeing dung or garbage, dung, garbage, and sweeping in a dream. Interpretation of a dungeon in a dream: seeing dung, garbage, or Garbage in a dream indicates the world because the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, likened the world to garbage when he stood in front of him one day.

And without his earnings. And the dungeon is like money collected from here and there without piety and sacrifice, due to the abundance of mixtures, dirt, and filth. If he is single, he will get married. The scavengers were their straw, and their straw was wiped from every side, bought from every place, and borrowed from every house.
