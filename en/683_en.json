But the presence of signs close to the realization of the vision does not mean that it can be achieved on the ground, because God alone knows the events of the future. They engage in promising dreams and wait for them to come true, while others are afraid of disturbing dreams that fear their appearance in reality, visions should not control the dreamer's mind in the first place. Signs of the imminent realization of the vision That the situation of the viewer is similar between reality and the dream, whether on a personal, psychological, professional, social or emotional level. That the place of the dream is similar to the place of reality without any change in the details of the place on the ground, such as dreaming of the house, workplace, university, school and other places where dreams abound. If changes occur in the situation in the dream, the dream may come true, but not soon, and God knows best.

Does the vision include anything that may cause him fear and distress? The dreamer may see in a dream a religious vision such as seeing the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, in a dream, because the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever sees me has seen me in a dream because Satan does not appear in my image.” It is also among the other religious symbols that indicate the truthfulness of the vision that he dreams of, the Holy Qur’an, mosques and the sky. That the dreamer sees the vision while he is in purity. That the dreamer sees the vision after praying, seeking forgiveness or supplicating to God. That the dreamer sees the vision during Ramadan or during the Hajj period. That the vision is close to the Day of Resurrection, as the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said in his noble hadith: “At the end of time, the vision of the believer is false.” When does the dream appear after its interpretation? The duration of the realization of the true vision represents a point of disagreement among dream interpretation jurists. Other scholars have argued that the vision can come true after many years, such as the vision of the Prophet Joseph, may God bless him and grant him peace, which came true when he dreamed of the planets, the sun and the moon in his youth and in his old age.

But the presence of signs close to the realization of the vision does not mean that it can be achieved on the ground, because God alone knows the events of the future. They engage in promising dreams and wait for them to come true, while others are afraid of disturbing dreams that fear their appearance in reality, visions should not control the dreamer's mind in the first place. Signs of the imminent realization of the vision That the situation of the viewer is similar between reality and the dream, whether on a personal, psychological, professional, social or emotional level. That the place of the dream is similar to the place of reality without any change in the details of the place on the ground, such as dreaming of the house, workplace, university, school and other places where dreams abound. If changes occur in the situation in the dream, the dream may come true, but not soon, and God knows best. That the time in the dream is similar to the time in reality, such as the dreamer seeing that the dream occurred at dawn, which is the actual time in which he saw the vision.

The vision is not the result of self-talk, which means The dreamer thinks a lot about the symbol of the vision before he dreams about it. Does the vision include anything that may cause him fear and distress? The dreamer may see in a dream a religious vision such as seeing the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, in a dream, because the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever sees me has seen me in a dream because Satan does not appear in my image.” It is also among the other religious symbols that indicate the truthfulness of the vision that he dreams of, the Holy Qur’an, mosques and the sky. That the dreamer sees the vision while he is in purity. That the dreamer sees the vision after praying, seeking forgiveness or supplicating to God. That the dreamer sees the vision during Ramadan or during the Hajj period. That the vision is close to the Day of Resurrection, as the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said in his noble hadith: “At the end of time, the vision of the believer is false.” When does the dream appear after its interpretation? The duration of the realization of the true vision represents a point of disagreement among dream interpretation jurists. Other scholars have argued that the vision can come true after many years, such as the vision of the Prophet Joseph, may God bless him and grant him peace, which came true when he dreamed of the planets, the sun and the moon in his youth and in his old age.
