This is evidence that he repented to God Almighty with sincere repentance, and that he repented of the disobedience and sins he committed. This is evidence of the turmoil in this person’s life, and it also indicates that this person does not have the insight to distinguish between what is permissible and what is forbidden, and between what is permissible to do and what is not permissible. Whoever sees in a dream that he is vomiting pearls? This is evidence that this person will become a scientist.
