Seeing riding a plane in a dream Ibn Sirin does not deserve anything, Ibn Sirin's interpretation of the plane is not available to us, because the plane and today's means of transportation were not common in the time of the Sheikh. Seeing the plane or flying indicates high ambitions and desires, hard work to achieve other goals, and remarkable successes at all levels. This vision is also an indication of power, strength and authority, achieving a prestigious position and achieving remarkable achievements. If a person sees that it is flying, this indicates travel in the near future and permanent travel and the ability to achieve the desired goal of this travel, whether it is work or study. This vision also expresses a rapid change in circumstances, entering another life and the need to adapt to new variables, so that a person does not miss the opportunities and offers before his eyes. If the viewer does not feel fear while driving the plane, this indicates entering into new experiences and entering into exciting adventures and gaining a lot of experience and achieving great profits. As for if the person is controlling the air traffic, this symbolizes control over all current situations and transferring complete responsibility to him and the need to be careful not to make any mistake that could harm him. In short, seeing riding a plane is an indication of a journey towards God, or in other words, walking on the path of truth, and the desire to reach To the great Lord with good deeds. Seeing riding a plane in a dream for a single woman. Seeing riding a plane in her dream shows the changes in "
