            "text": "Interpretation of seeing dates in a dream:\n\nIt's natural for humans to dream about things they don't understand or know the meaning of, like different types of food. Someone might see dates in a dream, or other food items, which have various interpretations explained by a number of commentators so that the person knows what they symbolize.\n\n**Interpretation of seeing Ajwa dates in a dream:**\n\nThe appearance of dates in a dream is a sign that good things are coming to the dreamer in the future, as dates don't always bring bad luck.\n\nSeeing Ajwa dates in a dream means the dreamer will acquire a lot of money, possibly from a deal or project they're involved in, which means the source of this money is legitimate, not from haram sources.\n\nTheir presence in a dream can indicate the success the dreamer achieves from God in all aspects of their daily life, as well as achieving some things they've been searching for for a long time.\n\nPalm trees in a dream symbolize the dreamer suffering from a serious illness that's hard to overcome, which means they will recover soon and this illness won't return, and they will live a life full of vitality, health and well-being.\n\nSeeing dates in a dream suggests the dreamer will be able to overcome any problems that might bring sadness to their heart or upset their life, and also allows them to achieve many goals that bring joy and happiness to every moment they live.\n\nGiving dates as a gift to someone symbolizes a connection between the dreamer and this person in this life, and this connection encompasses all relationships, whether marriage, friendship, work, or others.\n\n**Ajwa dates in a dream according to Ibn Sirin:**\n\nThe scholar Ibn Sirin explained all the situations where a person might see dates in a dream, which can be interpreted as follows:\n\nSeeing them in a dream indicates the person is working to achieve all their goals and desires they've dreamt of and they are able to do so, in addition to feeling a complete state of satisfaction, relaxation, and material and spiritual comfort in their future life.\n\nEating dates might indicate the person is confused about many decisions they need to make in their life and unable to determine many important and fateful issues.\n\nThe state of the person eating them from the tree indicates the seer will gain a lot of material benefits from some work they do in their life, which will change the course of their days for the better and make them feel happy.\n\nPicking the fruits means the man will get a good wife who is well-respected and has a significant influence in the community she lives in, if the gathering is done at the designated time this plant grows.\n\nThe state of the taste of the dates and feeling like they're the best things to eat in the dream means this seer has a lot of piety in their life and they follow everything God has commanded them to do, they don't commit sins and wrongdoings and try to gain God's pleasure in all possible ways.\n\nDates' seeds falling in the dream might indicate the dreamer will be able to overcome all the difficult circumstances they're going through, and they will not have a lot of worries and problems they suffer from in life.\n\nFalling on someone at times other than the designated times they can grow symbolizes some obstacles or problems in the dreamer's life, and they will suffer from them for a long time until they overcome them.\n\nReceiving dates from a loved one like a mother, in the case of her death, this vision shows the great good that will prevail for the dreamer and that they will be able to achieve everything they try in life, it also indicates they will receive many promotions or great commercial success and blessings.\n\nBurying dates in a dream is something that might mean this person is trampling over orphans' money and eating haram food in their stomach, which is one of the greatest sins in God's sight.\n\nEating Ajwa dates when they contain a seed or pit inside them indicates the person has many worries and suffers from mental disturbances and cannot determine what they can do in their life or make the important fateful decisions they need.\n\n**Interpretation of dreams about dates in a dream for a single woman:**\n\nThe presence of dates in a dream for a girl who has never married indicates she will be able to eliminate everything that hinders her life and get rid of all the things that cause her sadness or grief, and solve all the problems she suffers from in various areas of her life.\n\nFor a girl who has never married, eating Ajwa dates in her sleep means she has achieved some valuable things in her life and has been able to achieve what she has dreamt of throughout her life, and also shows what she loves in this world, which is limitless sustenance and great good.\n\nTheir appearance in a dream for a single woman indicates she will soon get a good husband who will be the reason for her feeling happy throughout her days and will work to achieve all the desires she has dreamt of.\n\nTheir presence in a woman's dream symbolizes that she will acquire some important things that can serve her throughout all periods of her life, and will be one of the most important reasons that allow her to change her living conditions to the best conditions and feel joy and happiness.\n\n**Ajwa dates in a dream about a married woman:**\n\nThe appearance of dates in a dream for a woman in the case of her marriage might mean that she will achieve many material gains in life and she will use this money to achieve her dreams and benefit people with it, and this is the reason for the joy of her days.\n\nTheir presence in a dream for the woman means she is going through a state of stability in her married life and is not suffering from family disputes that might disrupt life or bring sadness and anxiety to the whole house.\n\nSeeing these things in a dream for the woman indicates her recovery from all kinds of diseases that afflict her body and feeling rapid improvement, and that this disease will not return to her throughout her life no matter how dangerous it is.\n\nAjwa dates, if present in a married woman's dream, symbolize her ability to control her life and maintain all the requirements of her home.\n"

Seeing a blind dead man in a dream can be evidence that the dreamer will go through problems and troubles, and that his circumstances will not be good, especially financially. Whoever sees someone he knows who has died and is blind in a dream, this indicates that the place where he lives is full of deceit and deception, and he is not affected by that, and he must remain righteous.
