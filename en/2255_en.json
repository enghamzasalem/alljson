            "html": " Dreaming of betrayal in a dream has a bad effect on its owner when he wakes up. What is the interpretation of this dream, betrayal is one of the worst things that a person can go through, a very bad feeling that can have many bad consequences, as homes can be destroyed and children injured. These are negative things and to learn the interpretation of the dream of betrayal in a dream, follow us. Interpretation of the dream of betrayal by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin's dream of betrayal is an expression of fear and anxiety between the two sides. Al-Nabulsi also confirmed this interpretation, as they both said that they saw betrayal in a dream: A person always sees the pajamas of betrayal, because it indicates fear and severe anxiety, and a lot of thinking about the matter due to the insincerity of the party thinking about this matter, and therefore it is a constant source of doubt for those around him. It is said that when a rich person dreams of betrayal with money. But if someone sees that his friend is betraying him, this is an indication that this person is surrounded by friends who do not love you. If a woman sees that someone close to her is betraying her, this is a sign that she does not trust this person and that she expects something strange from him. And whoever sees in his dream what God has forbidden from adultery with a beautiful woman, this indicates that this person is losing, even that he put his money in an unsafe place. If a person sees in his dream that he is betraying the wife of someone he knows, this indicates that this person wants to get something from the fortune teller from his money. Whoever sees in his dream that it is prostitution, it is an indication that this person will face many problems, because this vision shows that there are those who want to take money from him. This vision means that there are some repercussions, courts and cases as well. And when an unmarried girl sees adultery in a dream, this is evidence of her betrayal and theft. Interpretation of a dream of seeing the betrayal of the real Imam’s husband Imam al-Sadiq explained the opinion of marital infidelity between the wife and her husband that she feels anxious and sad because he is always away from her and busy. Imam al-Sadiq added that this husband does not He values ​​his wife and shows a deterioration in the family life between them. Betrayal in a dream can also mean that the husband will leave his job or suffer from financial problems and say it with his money, and God Almighty knows that very well. As for the interpretation of the husband’s betrayal of his wife according to Imam al-Sadiq, he indicated that there is nothing between them in the absence of previous problems or events that created these doubts. Interpretation of a dream of betrayal of an unmarried girl When a girl sees that her fiancé is betraying her in a dream, this is a warning that her fiancé does not love her and she may face many problems between them in the future. Therefore, the single girl should think carefully about her fiancé. Seeing a lover betraying another girl in a dream is a sign that their relationship will end, whether it is an official affiliation or anything else. As for seeing her fiancé betraying her with another girl, just talking to him and accompanying him, her dream represents her happy marriage.
