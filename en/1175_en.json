Ibn Sirin's fish symbolizes women, marriage, life's hardships, and the ability to achieve the goal and enter into great challenges aimed at proving yourself, gaining a personal entity, and confirming identity. If an unmarried woman sees that she is eating fish, this is a sign of indulging in sterile, pointless quarrels, and distraction due to the discussions and discussions that she is forced to engage in and the presence of those who target her. And they try to steal her focus and vitality to disrupt her business and future projects.
