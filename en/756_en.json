Indeed, the problems surrounding a person can increase if he loses the phone in the vision, and Ibn Sirin shows many indications that the dream confirms if you want to know the most important interpretations of the dream of losing your mobile phone and some of its meanings, you should follow us in our article. Interpretation of dreams about losing a mobile phone If you see that your mobile phone is lost in your dream, most of the meanings are often not reassuring, because losing it warns you of bad conditions that sweep your life and may be related to work or your personal relationship with some people, which means that there are new crises that appear to you and bother you, and if the girl is engaged, you may face some bad surprises, you need a break and you may think about getting out of the relationship you are in. If you see that you lose your phone in a dream and cannot find it again, the meaning indicates that there is some sad news that you will hear soon and embarrassing situations and bad times may occur for the dreamer while he is full of joy. And I hope again if he finds the lost mobile phone from him because if it is not found, the threats may become many and he may fall into many bad situations. Interpretation of a dream about losing a mobile phone by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin says: “Losing a phone in a dream is one of the warning signs for the sleeper, as he goes through many bad and difficult situations and may lose the task he is currently working on. Strong study of the project and successful planning for it or patience for some time. Ibn Sirin indicates that losing a mobile phone in a dream is an undesirable sign that your relationship with your partner may be tense for a long time or you may be exposed to the loss and theft of valuable things you own, such as a thief entering the house and stealing some valuable things from it, and if you find your mobile phone again, many bad things around you will be fixed and your situations will become more comfortable and safe for you. Interpretation of a dream about losing a mobile phone for a single woman When the sign sees the loss of the new phone you have in a dream, experts say that there are surprises around him and most of them are not happy and may change for the better provided that you can find the mobile phone again. He should also be careful of his actions and the procedures he takes if he sees that her phone is lost in the dream. The student can see the loss of the mobile phone in the vision and from here she must pay close attention to her studies and avoid neglecting them because she is exposed to some events and issues that bother her such as failure in it. A year or meeting circumstances that lead her to severe sadness, meaning she will go through a period of despair or disappointment, God forbid. This problem is addressed if he is able to find the phone and it is not completely lost, he will find it well and will be able to correct some bad situations and be happy in the future, God willing.
