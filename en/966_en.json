What is the reality of this dream? Is it good or bad, we will answer that through an encyclopedia according to what was presented by the most prominent Arab Muslim scholars, as the world of dreams is a complex world and it is not good to rely on people who are not qualified to explain it. Scientists have considered that praying in a direction other than the qiblah is contrary to the congregation, because it may indicate the dreamer’s need to repent, and it may indicate his good news. Arab scholars.Interpretation of praying in a dream other than the direction of the Qiblah. Sheikh Al-Nabulsi presented his interpretation of the vision of praying in the opposite direction of the Qiblah, and we explain it as follows: The dream of a person seeing himself in a dream praying in a direction other than the Qiblah, towards the east, is interpreted as an innovative and evil personality, weak in religion, and daring to commit Sins. Seeing the same person praying with his back to the Qiblah indicates that he has distanced himself from religion and left Islam behind his back and does not care about its strictness. Al-Nabulsi interprets the meaning of someone who prays in a direction other than the Qiblah in his sleep, and disobeys God’s obligation and law, and sees that he is swearing falsely to God, or slandering a believing, chaste woman. Dreaming of wearing white, praying behind the Qiblah, and reciting the Qur’an correctly indicates the dreamer’s Hajj. The dream of searching for the Qiblah, according to Al-Nabulsi, proves that asking about the direction of the Qiblah is confusion in religious matters. Facing the prayer in the Qiblah correctly symbolizes the integrity of the Prophet. And the righteousness of Islam. What is the interpretation of a dream about praying in a direction other than the Qiblah, by Ibn Sirin? The interpreter Ibn Sirin defined prayer as committing sins without repentance or repentance, and there are other definitions, including: Praying in a direction other than the Qiblah and the dreamer’s joy indicates that he will follow falsehood and fall into heresy. Prayer A person’s ignorance of the Qiblah indicates that he is surrounded by hypocrites and bad manners. Seeing the rulers or leaders praying in the direction of the Qiblah symbolizes his removal from his position. Whoever prays with the Qiblah behind his back indicates that he is committing sins and doing what God does not permit and the Messenger is not pleased with. Interpretation of prayer in the direction of The Qiblah by Ibn ShaheenThe kiss in a dream is considered the best criterion for whoever sees it, and the farther away it is from the Qiblah, the further away it is from religion and vice versa. Ibn Shaheen explained that whoever does not care about a Qiblah is a clear sign of hypocrisy, and that the dreamer is concerned with the appearances of religion and not its essence, and this is evidence of that person’s hypocrisy. Interpretation A dream about Western prayer. The dreamer’s prayer to the west of the Qiblah is interpreted by the number of deviations from the direction of the Qiblah in the dream. God Almighty said in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse No. 114: “We have seen your face in the sky, so let us kiss you, so you will be pleased with your face which did not.” And whoever sees himself deviating from the Qiblah more From a quarter of the circle, he has deviated from Islam. And if his deviation from the Qiblah was in a quarter of the circle, then he is on the right path, “and the truth is better to follow.” Seeing people reaching the Qiblah foretells their misguidance and negligence.
