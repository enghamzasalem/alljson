Who among us does not dream of seeing his beloved all the time? When a lover sees his beloved, his heart beats and feels great happiness, but when he sees someone you love looking at you, the meaning in the dream may differ depending on the feelings that unite the two lovers, whether they are from both sides or from one side, and we will understand this in detail through Opinions of interpreters and jurists. What is the interpretation of a dream about someone you love looking at you? If the dreamer sees that this lover appreciates him and fears his sadness, then through him his life will be blessed with goodness and happiness in everything, as his Lord honors him with many good deeds at this time. As for his sharp and frightening look at him, This indicates that dangerous circumstances will come upon the dreamer, who will work hard to overcome them so as not to oppress him and bring him down. Watching the deceased in this state while continuing to look at the dreamer, there is no doubt that he needs some charity that will save him in the afterlife, so this demand on him must be met. As quickly as possible. The look and smile are followed by great kindness, as we all feel happy about this sight, even if it is from afar, so the vision is good news if the lover is really happy. The face. The dreamer seeing this dream expresses his constant preoccupation with this person and his need Until he is actually with him at the first opportunity. But if this person does not love the dreamer in reality, but rather sees him in his dream looking at him, then he must be very careful about him and his actions, as he is planning a plot to defeat him in his work. His smile is evidence of overcoming hardships and emerging from sorrows, no matter how harmful they are, and the dreamer will live as he wants, thanks to God Almighty. The abundance of joy is sure evidence of the abundance of goodness that the dreamer will soon receive and that he will live with an increased reward from the Lord of the Worlds and will quickly overcome everything that harms him. Interpretation of a dream About someone you love looking at you. Interpretation of a dream about someone you love looking at you in Ibn Sirini. The great Sheikh Ibn Shirin promises us that the vision is a sign of marriage, happiness, and distance from problems and worries, especially when we look at it with a smile. It also indicates a promotion at work, which increases your income and makes you achieve everything She wants. If a married woman’s dream indicates her stability and happiness with her husband and that she will not go through fears that disturb her life, but rather will find a suitable solution to any problem she faces with the help of her husband. He understands her. A smile is the perfect solution to overcome worries and crises. If the dreamer sees this beloved smiling, then he should know that his life will be happy and nothing will disturb him. This makes him sad. Perhaps the smile is an affirmation of the love of this person already, and the vision is an indication of what The beloved carries it in his heart to reassure himself and feel comfortable. It can be evidence that they share common interests that will change their lives for the happier, and the vision is good news for the success of cooperation between them and the necessity of continuing on this blessed path.
