May God give you your hand, and if you come to Him you will walk? You came in a hurry, mentioning God Almighty the blessings that God gives to His creation, because if you mention God Almighty in one of the gatherings, then mentioning God to you in a meeting is better than it, so a person must always remember God Almighty. For the sake of his happiness.Interpretation of dosha in a dream according to Ibn Sirin. The vision of God’s glorification in a dream varies depending on who sees it, as well as how the rosary is used. The scholar Ibn Sirin explained the presence of the rosary in a dream that this person will be blessed by God Almighty. Interpretation of the rosary in a dream is evidence of the presence of a respectable woman in this man’s life. This woman could be his mother, wife, sister or any other woman. But if someone dreams that he is glorifying the rosary in a dream, this is evidence that this person will be blessed by God in the coming years of his life with prosperity and happiness that he will live with his family. Interpretation of a blessing in a dream But if this person dreams that he is buying a rosary in a dream. This is evidence that God will marry soon and his wife will be a righteous woman who will help him obey God Almighty, carry out what He commands, and stay away from what God has forbidden if the dreamer is single, but if the fortuneteller is married. This is evidence that that man’s wife gives birth to a girl. But if someone sees in a dream that he is giving the rosary to someone else? This is evidence that this person gives advice and guidance to those around him, but if he sees in a dream that someone is offering him a rosary, then advice and guidance will be given to him. This is evidence that God Almighty gives this person the best in the world, but if he sees in a dream that he has lost a rosary or sold a rosary. He should approach God Almighty and ask for His forgiveness. May God forgive him. Because the rosary was lost or sold. Evidence that this man lacks his Lord and needs to repent quickly. Interpretation of seeing the rosary in a dream according to Al-Nabulsi. Al-Nabulsi explained that seeing the rosary in a dream has different interpretations, such as: If a married woman sees the rosary in a dream? This is evidence that this woman will live a decent life with her husband, but if a married woman sees that her husband is giving her a rosary while he is white, then it is not permissible for her to do so. This is evidence of God Almighty’s good news of her imminent pregnancy, God willing. But if she sees that her husband is offering her a blue rosary, does she have the right to do that? This is evidence that God Almighty has mercy on this woman, but if the rosary that her husband gave her is green, then it is not permissible for her to do so. This is evidence that this woman will raise her sons and daughters with a good upbringing, and this family will enjoy good morals and noble characteristics as a result of this upbringing. If a pregnant woman sees the rosary in her dream, this is evidence that God Almighty will facilitate the birth of this woman, and God Almighty will marry her, and evidence that Almighty God will satisfy this woman’s desires and make her life happy.

The vision of God’s glorification in a dream varies depending on who sees it, as well as how the rosary is used. The scholar Ibn Sirin explained the presence of the rosary in a dream that this person will be blessed by God Almighty. Interpretation of the rosary in a dream is evidence of the presence of a respectable woman in this man’s life. This woman could be his mother, wife, sister or any other woman. But if someone dreams that he is glorifying the rosary in a dream, this is evidence that this person will be blessed by God in the coming years of his life with prosperity and happiness that he will live with his family. Interpretation of a blessing in a dream But if this person dreams that he is buying a rosary in a dream. This is evidence that God will marry soon and his wife will be a righteous woman who will help him obey God Almighty, carry out what He commands, and stay away from what God has forbidden if the dreamer is single, but if the fortuneteller is married. This is evidence that that man’s wife gives birth to a girl. But if someone sees in a dream that he is giving the rosary to someone else? This is evidence that this person gives advice and guidance to those around him, but if he sees in a dream that someone is offering him a rosary, then advice and guidance will be given to him. This is evidence that God Almighty gives this person the best in the world, but if he sees in a dream that he has lost a rosary or sold a rosary. He should approach God Almighty and ask for His forgiveness. May God forgive him. Because the rosary was lost or sold. Evidence that this man lacks his Lord and needs to repent quickly. Interpretation of seeing the rosary in a dream according to Al-Nabulsi. Al-Nabulsi explained that seeing the rosary in a dream has different interpretations, such as: If a married woman sees the rosary in a dream? This is evidence that this woman will live a decent life with her husband, but if a married woman sees that her husband is giving her a rosary while he is white, then it is not permissible for her to do so. This is evidence of God Almighty’s good news of her imminent pregnancy, God willing. But if she sees that her husband is offering her a blue rosary, does she have the right to do that? This is evidence that God Almighty has mercy on this woman, but if the rosary that her husband gave her is green, then it is not permissible for her to do so. This is evidence that this woman will raise her sons and daughters with a good upbringing, and this family will enjoy good morals and noble characteristics as a result of this upbringing. If a pregnant woman sees the rosary in her dream, this is evidence that God Almighty will facilitate the birth of this woman, and God Almighty will marry her, and evidence that Almighty God will satisfy this woman’s desires and make her life happy.
