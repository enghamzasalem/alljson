            "html": " The meaning of the tashahhud in a dream. Through these lines, we present to you the meaning of the dream of the tashahhud in a dream. Interpretations differ according to the psychological state of the pioneer and according to the symbols and elements, and we will learn this together. The meaning of the Tashahhud in the dreams of Muhammad Ibn Sirin is that whoever sees himself uttering the two Shahadas in a dream while he is dying, this is evidence of his closeness to God and his heart’s attachment to worship and prayer and the dreamer’s love for doing good to others.. Ibn Sirin says, in interpreting the vision of the Tashahhud and pronouncing the two Shahadas, that this vision indicates the righteous and abundant judgment that awaits the dreamer in the future. Ibn Sirin explains that whoever sees himself in a dream saying: “There is no god but God” is evidence that the dreamer will enter Paradise after his death. Seeing the dreamer himself narrating the two testimonies correctly, without errors, is evidence that the dreamer has achieved his dreams and success in his life. It indicates the dreamer’s obedience to God and the performance of many good deeds. As for the divorced woman who sees in a dream that she is pronouncing the Shahada, it is considered good news that she will soon return to her homeland. Her husband after many disagreements and problems between them. The meaning of a dream about pronouncing the Shahada in a single woman’s dream: Seeing an unmarried girl in a dream pronouncing the Shahada correctly and in a manner without mistakes or stumbles is evidence of good character. Dream interpreters said that seeing an unmarried woman dying and reciting the Shahada in a dream is considered an unpleasant dream. It explains that a woman will be exposed to some great troubles or tribulations in her life, but she will live on later, and it is an invitation for her to get closer to God and persevere in prayer, good deeds, and supplication.
