            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about breastfeeding a single woman If we dream that breastfeeding a single woman indicates confusion, there is no doubt that breastfeeding is only for married women, so the single woman finds many disturbing feelings from this dream, although breastfeeding is important for the child and is the basis of his life. Here we do not see that the dream has bad connotations, but rather carries good meanings except in certain cases, which we will all understand through the interpretations of our honorable scholars. Interpretation of a dream of breastfeeding a single woman What is the interpretation of a dream of breastfeeding for a single woman? Seeing breastfeeding in a dream for an unmarried woman means happiness and continuous goodness because breastfeeding is of great importance to the child. Perhaps the vision of breastfeeding indicates her love and tenderness towards others and her generous spirit that makes her unique to everyone around her. If an unmarried woman cannot breastfeed a child during her sleep, this means that she is facing a crisis or that it affects her and harms her, so she continues to pray until she gets rid of this feeling. The vision is a sign of sustenance and tremendous goodness, and this makes her constantly grateful to her Lord without stopping until He honors her in the future with double her livelihood. If you see that she is breastfeeding a man or an old man, this leads to physical fatigue that does not go away except by mentioning God and taking care of her health until she gets rid of this fatigue immediately. Perhaps the vision is a sign of her imminent marriage, as she is very happy with this marriage to the ideal partner. The vision expresses his progress in work, and he is moving forward without retreating, thanks to His distinction and love for work, which provides him with many innovative ideas permanently. If you see that there is difficulty in breastfeeding, this dream leads to failure in some important matters in life. Breastfeeding in a dream indicates a happy change in life instead of distress, no matter how harsh the circumstances are. Perhaps the vision indicates her happy relationship with her family without mentioning any harm that may befall her in life, as she always reaches her stomach without any neglect. Or it may indicate that she does not feel tenderness from others and her constant search for someone who understands her and gives her the tenderness that she lacks and does not feel at this time, so her Lord compensates her and honors her with someone who has already given her. She has this love at the first opportunity. What is the interpretation of a dream about breastfeeding an unmarried woman according to Ibn Sirin? Our Imam Ibn Sirin believes that this dream expresses the prosperity and happy life that awaits her during her professional and future life. The vision may indicate happy news that changes her life and makes her happy and satisfied, especially if she is breastfeeding a female and not a man. Seeing artificial breastfeeding in a dream does not indicate evil, but rather is a sign of goodness and bliss in this world and the hereafter, as well as standing by those who need it. Increased milk in a dream is evidence of increased sustenance from the Lord of the Worlds. If she cries during her sleep while breastfeeding, this makes her feel upset as a result of a dispute or problem between her and someone close to her, whether from her friends or her family. Likewise, if a child cries while breastfeeding in a dream, this leads to many problems. ",
