In this meeting, we will discuss the interpretation of lipstick in a dream, according to a modern psychological approach based on the meaning of the symbol in the subconscious and the meanings associated with it in the dream. Before proceeding to interpret the lip line or “redness” in a dream, let us get to know its meaning in wakefulness. Lipstick is a cosmetic product that consists mainly of oils or wax dye, which is placed on the lips to give them a distinctive color, often in shades of red such as pink and others. The primary function of lipstick in its wake is beautification, and it is a cosmetic for women only, and in some conservative Arab societies, these cosmetics are limited to married women and may be considered hateful to girls. Through the functional approach of lipstick in wakefulness, which is cosmetic, we can see that this symbol has a positive connotation in wakefulness, which is a positive change for the better. In addition to the functional approach of this symbol, we can deduce its meaning through the verbal approach, as the word consists of two parts (red and lips). The color red or red in the interpretation has multiple meanings. Red is the color of blood and life and it is the color of desire because it is the color of fire and it is the symbol of a woman or a woman and it is the color of gold and the color of death and the color of killing.

As for the lips or lips in the interpretation, they symbolize the word and the saying, and they cover the fortune-telling because they cover the teeth, and it is a symbol of smiling, and it is a symbol of sadness, if the dreamer sees that. He bites it. \"If we take the functional specifications and then the semantic meaning of the word, we find that lipstick in a dream is not just cosmetics as we thought at first glance, but it can exceed it to an extreme degree, and this is what you will discover in succession in the following paragraphs. Lipstick in the dream of a girl or a single girl The single girl who sees in her dream that she is buying lipstick may be on the verge of change or renewal in her life, because all cosmetics and cosmetics in a dream indicate the desire for renewal or the aspiration for change, whether on an emotional or practical level. Or social level. If a girl sees in her dream that she is decorating or beautifying herself and then putting lipstick on her lips, she may be on the verge of an imminent change, according to the linguistic approach of the word Safa, which means close to the subject: “the thing or country that he saw, that is, close to it). Do not forget, brothers and sisters, that the red color in the interpretation indicates a warning or danger, especially if the dreamer hates seeing it while awake. Lipstick in a dream can be a sign of marriage, especially if the dreamer did not use it while awake, as we mentioned in the introduction to the article. Putting on lipstick is limited to married women only, especially in some conservative Arab regions.
