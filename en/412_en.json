            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about an injured eye in a dream Some people are surprised when they see the eye in a dream, especially if the eye is afflicted with a disease or injury, so many of us are looking for the best interpretation of this vision, and the eye is the most important means for a person, because it is responsible for obtaining external images from the sensory world to enter the field of the mind to classify and arrange them and then turn them into logical knowledge, and what concerns us in this article is reporting the consequences of seeing the affected. Eye. Interpretation of a dream about an injured eye in a dream The sight of the eye generally expresses insight and insight into the course of things and a wise mind capable of distinguishing right from wrong, good from evil. If the eye is injured, it symbolizes a lack of clarity of vision, falling into the conspiracies and traps that life sets for a person, confusing right from wrong, doing what the soul dictates instead of guiding the mind and deviating from logical laws. Visual sight is a reference to the sensory images that a person sees from the outside world that enter the realm of the mind to be rationalized, arranged and formulated into patterns that enable the viewer to determine priorities and decisions in a sophisticated manner. If he sees that his eye has a defect or injury, this indicates a loss of the ability to make the right decision, severe confusion in every situation he is in, and dispersion between more than one goal, and then the inability to achieve what is desired. The goal, he can achieve many goals, but they are secondary goals that do not meet his true desires. The eye symbolizes religion, and if it is polluted, it indicates a lack of religion or failure to perform the obligatory duties, or considering the truth as falsehood, and seeing falsehood as truth, which results in heresy and introducing beliefs that contradict common sense in the correct faith. If the fortune teller sees weakness in his eyesight, this indicates the difficulties of life related in one way or another to his children. It arises to provide them with help and rescue them from their critical predicament. Also, seeing the affected eye indicates need, deterioration of the condition, lack of time, and facing many problems and difficulties that prevent the person from living normally. If the eye is polluted from the inside, this symbolizes the inability to give the correct answers, misjudging the things that happen around you and making wrong judgments against others, which leads to the loss of many relationships and the loss of people who love you. Ibn Shaheen refers in his interpretation of the sight of the eye that it expresses a person's religion, so if he is struck blind, he strips himself of the cloak of religion, abandons common sense, and violates collective beliefs for the sake of internal whims. Corruption of vision and the need for rational judgment. Psychologically, the affected eye is considered evidence of many personal expectations and predictions about many future matters, and this, although it has an indication of insight and insight into the future, has psychological damage in the form of disappointments, such as reality.
