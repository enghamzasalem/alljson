Hajj is one of the most beautiful acts of worship that every Muslim aspires to, and seeing it in a dream is one of the things that brings joy and peace to the dreamer’s soul. We will explain this through the Al-Qimma website. Interpretation of seeing Hajj in a dream by Ibn SirinIbn Sirin explained in his talk about interpreting a dream about Hajj that attending Hajj in a dream can lead to different interpretations, the most important of which are the following: If we see a person circumambulating in a dream while performing some rituals, This may be a sign of his closeness to God, the intensity of his faith and the goodness of his circumstances. The vision also indicates the abundance of sustenance and the dreamer’s support in funds for Muslims. Ibn Sirin also said: Whoever sees that he will perform Hajj in isolation will return to the state, and if he is a traveler he will arrive, and if he is a merchant he will benefit. Of his trade, even if he is sick, God. He will be cured of illness. And if he is in debt, God will replace his debt with him. If he does not perform Hajj before performing the Hajj obligation, even if he is one of the wrongdoers, and God knows best. And whoever sees that he is performing Umrah or Hajj, he will live a long time and his deeds will be accepted. It also indicates a vision that people asked He performs Hajj alone and dies. Whoever dreams that it is obligatory for him to perform Hajj, but does not perform it, this indicates that he has betrayed his trust and does not thank God Almighty for that. And whoever sees that it is the Day of Arafah, his relative will come and reconcile his adversaries with him, and if he is absent, he will return to him.

Al-Nabulsi interpreted the vision of the dream of Hajj with many different meanings depending on the condition of the dreamer, and we can explain it as follows: In the case of the vision, if you see that you have completely completed the rituals of Hajj and have circumambulated the House Haram, then this indicates your integrity and safety. If you go to Hajj in a dream at the time of Hajj, and you travel in reality, then you have arrived. If you are a merchant, you will make a profit. If you are sick, you will be healed. If you are in debt, your debts will be paid. And whoever thinks that he went out Alone for Hajj, and the people left him and returned with someone else, this indicates his death. Hajj in a dream, according to Al-Nabulsi, also means goodness, honoring one’s parents, marrying an unmarried person, gaining lust, knowledge for the seeker, money for the poor, healing the sick, and separation between the bride and groom.
