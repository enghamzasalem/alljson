We translate it for a single girl, a married woman, a pregnant woman, a divorced woman, for a man who tends to see a jeweler or enter a gold shop in the market, to buy or sell a necklace, a ring or a gold necklace for Ibn Sirin and others in continuation of the topic: Interpretation of the goldsmith and the crafting of gold and jewelry in a dream It is possible that the goldsmith in a dream embodies an evil and lying person in whom there is no good, or that in a dream he is also the person who extracts something from something else. In the same context, seeing a goldsmith in a dream means lies and deceit, or it may even refer to the systems of constructing poetry and speech. Moreover, seeing a goldsmith indicates knowledge, marriage and joys, and usually a goldsmith in a dream represents a bad person with no good in him. Seeing an unknown jeweler is one who lies and fabricates stories. If a goldsmith sees in a dream that he is mounting gold and silver jewelry, he is a person composed of people with something that begins with evil and ends with good. Gold in a dream, as in reality, is a treasure for the one who sees it and success in a task she performs. Seeing gold in a dream for a married woman means that she will soon become pregnant. If you see yourself wearing gold, especially a gold bracelet, this symbolizes that you will inherit a large inheritance.
