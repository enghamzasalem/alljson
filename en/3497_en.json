In interpreting dreams, Freud said that he was the first to look at the mind and develop the theory of its basis and creation. Freud's statements in \"Dreams\" about consciousness and the unconscious described the ethereal parts of the mind that make us human. In fact, it laid the foundation for our current thinking about the mind. Before that, thinking was more spiritual.

If you see yourself crying and you are a sensitive person who starts crying just because you see someone crying in a movie, this does not scare him and there may not be any psychological distancing in your own life. Crying in a dream also indicates that the time has come To share your feelings or concerns with the people who are most important to you. These dreams may also indicate that you are suffering from depression and because it is not suitable for a healthy life, you will need to work your way over it.

Interpretation of dreams The fields of psychoanalysis, psychiatry and psychology have become an integral part of modern science, but much more important is the principle of scientific thinking about the mind. In the past, the brain was a material thing and the mind was part of the spiritual world. There was science about the brain and speculation about the mind, but after the emergence of the Austrian researcher Freud, the study of the mind became more serious and scientific. Regarding dreams, simply put, we first understood through Freud's theory that we dream for a reason. This reason is to deal with the problems of the unconscious that the conscious cannot deal with. This theory means that the mind sets its own rules for dreams and people have begun to discover these rules and their causes. In the interpretation of dreams, Freud said that he was the first to look at the mind and develop a theory of its basis and creation. Freud's statements in \"Dreams\" about the conscious and the unconscious described the ethereal parts of the mind that make us human. In fact, it laid the foundation for our current thinking about the mind. Before that, thinking was more spiritual.

If you see yourself crying in a dream after being hurt or hurt by someone on the ground, you can see yourself expressing your sadness in your dream by crying, and this is also an indication that you are an emotional person by nature and tend to be overwhelmed by circumstances. If you see yourself crying and you are a sensitive person who starts crying just because you see someone crying in a movie, this does not scare him and there may not be any psychological distancing in your private life. Crying in a dream also indicates that it is time to share your feelings or Your concerns with the people who matter most to you. These dreams may also indicate that you are depressed and because it is not suitable for a healthy life, you will need to work your way up to overcome it. Interpretation of the dream of crying in the dream book There are many ancient interpreters such as Ibn Sirin and Ibn Shaheen, and there are also modern commentators such as Muhammad Rateb Al-Nabulsi who wrote books on the interpretation of dreams.
