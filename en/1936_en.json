It indicates the completion of an order and the attainment of a message. Paying a debt, fulfilling a trust, or creating an obligation are duties of God Almighty. We said that its owner prepares for Hajj and avoids immorality, as God Almighty says: “Prayer forbids immorality and injustice.” The Sunnah indicates the purity of its owner, his patience with hardship, and the appearance of a good reputation. For him, according to the Almighty’s saying: And whoever has it in his hand and does good to them beyond what is necessary, and is obligated to eat and dress, and works diligently in the affairs of his friends, this will inherit honor and voluntary work for him. It requires the perfection of chivalry and the removal of worries. On a cloudy day in which the clouds have moved, and if he sees that he is praying the afternoon prayer, this indicates that the work he has is the least left. Interpretation of praying for people in a dream. Jurists say in the interpretation of dreams that seeing a person praying with people in a dream means that he will assume responsibility for people and become worthy of this position.
