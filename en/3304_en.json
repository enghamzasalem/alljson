            "html": " Conflict in a dream indicates a struggle with oneself and a struggle with obstacles, and sometimes it means a struggle within oneself between established values ​​and desires. Wrestling in a dream indicates victory, victory, or success for the defeated. It may be desirable for the patient to recover. In this article, we will introduce you to two main ways to interpret or express a dream about wrestling: The first is Ibn Sirin’s approach, which is classified as a religious or classical approach. The second approach will be psychological. We wish you good luck with this interpretation. Fighting in a dream according to Ibn Sirin’s interpretation. Whoever sees in a dream a person suffering from epilepsy, his money will be ruined, and whoever is defeated in wrestling will be defeated in reality, and vice versa. If two men fight in a dream with the intention of fighting, the winner will be the winner. Whoever dreams that two men are fighting and one of them kills his partner, then the killer is the better of the two. Struggle is interpreted as rivalry, disagreement, strife, or conflict. If a woman sees that a man has fought her until he throws her to the ground and sits on her chest, then she will get married if she is single. Struggle is evidence of the illness of the defeated, and may indicate the patient’s recovery from his illness. Whoever dreams that a policeman throws him to the ground, he will commit a sin or disobedience, or his money will run away while he is sad. Interpretation of the meaning of wrestling in a dream for a single woman: Fighting in an unmarried girl’s dream is something worthy of praise if she sees in a dream that she is fighting with a familiar person from her family or neighbors. If he hits her or throws her on the ground until she lies on her back, this is an interpretation of marriage. If he does not know who killed her, it is feared that she will fall ill, fail, or fail. It is not worth interpreting to see an unmarried woman quarreling with her brother, father, or one of her relatives. Interpretation of the meaning of wrestling in a dream for a married woman: If a married woman sees a man other than her husband killing her until he throws her to the ground, then she will leave her husband with another man. Whoever sees in a dream that she fights her husband until she hits him, then leaves him or divorces him. If her husband knocks her to the ground, the dream heralds goodness between them. Because the basic principle of the matter is that the man dominates the woman. If a wife hits her husband in a dream, then she is leaving him, committing a sin, oppressing him, or bringing injustice. Ibn Sirin disliked the dominance of women over men in dreams. Especially if the dreamer is a woman, and if the dreamer is a man and sees in the dream a woman fighting with him, the interpretation may differ. Interpretation of the meaning of wrestling in a pregnant woman’s dream: Whoever sees a pregnant woman as if she is fighting a stranger and overcoming him, then she is overcoming an experience, pain, or a tiring stage of pregnancy. The majority of pregnant women in a dream about wrestling gain bliss, safety and security in their waking life. The vision remains very enjoyable unless death or a frightening or violent bloody scene appears in the dream. Absolute interpretation of the meaning of wrestling in a dreamWrestling in a final dream can indicate a struggle in life. If he sees that he is fighting with a stranger until he defeats him, he will conquer life and achieve a happy, stable life. Perhaps wrestling in a dream indicates a final self-fight. Perhaps it indicates marriage. ",
