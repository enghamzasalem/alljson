Interpretation of a dream about a wedding at home by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin says that this vision most often indicates that the dreamer’s life will witness many changes during the coming period. It also indicates that the person is preparing to enter a new stage in His life, perhaps he is preparing to do something new that he did not know before, perhaps he leaves home or moves away and travels. However, if the joy is very strong and the kindness and food vary in different shapes and colors, this indicates that the dreamer will be exposed to a major financial crisis that will push him to seek help from those around him. If he sees that he is going to a wedding where one of the parties is missing, whether it is the groom or the bride, this indicates that the dreamer will suffer a great loss, as he may lose something dear to him or fail.
