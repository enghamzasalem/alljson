            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about a colored cloak Seeing an cloak or an abaya in a dream is one of the visions that can be interpreted in more than one way, because the cloak that a person sees in his dream can be white, black, or colored, and the cloak can be small or large, in addition to the dreamer's condition in the dream and the extent to which the situation resembles his actual situation in reality, and the details he sees that contradict his vision of the cloak give other interpretations and evidence. What concerns us in this context is clarifying the vision of the colored cloak in a dream and what it symbolizes. Interpretation of a dream about a colored cloak The cloak symbolizes many blessed things that portend the dreamer's death with the death of worry and sadness, hearing happy news, and changing the current situation for the better or replacing it with another situation that is more in harmony with the situation and the dreamer's life. The colored cloak in a dream indicates an abundance of goodness and living, enjoying a state of joy and happiness, and starting life with a reassuring spirit and surrendering to God's destiny and the reasons that He places for man. The cloak is the cover that surrounds the dreamer's life, making him hide behind God's mercy and grace. The cloak also indicates luxury, enjoying blessings, and feeling comfortable Psychological and removing pressure from the shoulders. If the cloak symbolizes the jacket and cover with which a woman covers her charm, this means that the cloak indicates a man, whether he is a husband, father or brother. Seeing it in a dream indicates many qualities such as purity, chastity, modesty and high morals. Seeing a colored cloak is a notice to the viewer that there are many changes that will happen to him in the near future, which requires him to be fully alert so that he can comply and respond to these changes. This vision also symbolizes the important news that the visionary is looking forward to, and perhaps this news will make her happy. The colored cloak shows a positive outlook on life, optimism and clinging to every atom of hope. If the cloak is harmonious and beautiful, this indicates passion, abundance of feelings and a sense of calm, especially in a woman's sleep. In a man's dream, the vision symbolizes a strong and dominant personality whose strength stems from the charisma he possesses, and it also indicates the profits that the man earns from his extensive trade and profitable business. If the cloak is torn or worn, this indicates physical weakness, lack of self-confidence, or Deviation from the right path, which makes the viewer tend to the psychological defense methods mentioned by psychologists, such as the method of compensation or wrapping and clinging, as if the seer gives everything he has to others to get out of his predicament without any loss. If a woman sees that she is wearing a man's abaya, this indicates the woman's ability to do the hard work that a man does, which indicates her ability to endure and her ability to lead, manage and manage matters that seem difficult and complex. As for if the man is the one wearing the woman's abaya, this is evidence of the weakness of his personality, the ease of his leadership and formation like others, and his many characteristics that do not suit him, which makes him unable to manage his affairs.
