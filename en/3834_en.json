If a married woman sees a gecko in her bed, this may symbolize her husband’s betrayal and the approach of a disreputable woman to him. The symbol of the stomach in Ibn Sirin’s dream. Ibn Sirin says that the gecko is one of the insects that indicates the presence of devils or jinn, and seeing it in a dream is undesirable, and the dreamer must seek refuge in God and protect him.
