            "html": " I dream of graves and cemeteries for unmarried women, pregnant women, and divorced women, whether they visited graves or the dead, and dug open, closed, and closed graves for Ibn Sirin and others. So whoever of you sees that he visits graves, this dream indicates visiting prisoners and visiting the sick, and it also indicates that he is going through a financial crisis that is so serious He asks people, and God knows best. Interpretation of a grave in a dream: If you see graves in a dream, this portends sadness, failure, and loss in business. If the graves have hearts, this portends an incurable illness and death. If you see your grave in a dream, this foretells that you will get sick and live in an atmosphere of sadness and anxiety. If the witness reads what is written on the grave, this foretells that you will be assigned a job that you do not like. If you dream of seeing a freshly dug grave, you will have to suffer from other people's mistakes. If you visit a freshly dug grave, you are faced with serious risks. Dreaming of a grave is an ominous dream and bad luck will follow in business operations and also threatens illness. If you dream of walking over graves, this portends an early death or an unhappy marriage. If you look at an empty grave, this indicates disappointment and loss of friends. If you see a person in a grave whose body is covered in dirt except for his head, a sad situation will happen to him and you will want to lose his money. If you see your grave in a dream, this portends that enemies are working tirelessly to make you fall into disaster and they will succeed if you are not vigilant. To dream that you are digging a grave indicates anxiety about the undertaking, if enemies seek to besiege you, but you have finished digging the grave and will overcome obstacles. If the sun shines, goodness will come to you from visible clothing. If you return a corpse to bury it and find that it has disappeared, trouble will come to you from unknown destinations. If a woman dreams that night that she is in a cemetery, and finds no place to sleep except an open grave, this foretells that she will face sadness and disappointment due to death or false friends. You may lose love and discover that many things seek to harm it. If you see a barren cemetery far from the tops of the graves, it means a lot of sadness and despair for some time, but if you bear your burdens patiently, you will find greater benefits and joy waiting for you.
