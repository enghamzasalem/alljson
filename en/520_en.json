Interpretation of the land in a dream. Ibn Sirin said that seeing the land In a dream, it means earthly life with everything that heaven contains on the last day, and seeing the earth in a dream for a woman who gives birth and gives birth is like cultivated and plowed land. Whoever dreams that he is selling his land or sees that he has left his land, then he will die if he is afflicted with a disease, and for one who intends to travel, this is a sign On his travel. Whoever sees in his dream that the land is torn or torn apart and a young man comes out of it, then hatred and hostility will appear in that place, and if an old man comes out he rules the place. It indicates torment, and if it splits and a seed emerges from it, it indicates goodness and fertility in that place. Whoever sees that he is digging in the ground and eating sand and dirt, then he conspires with others to get money. Whoever sees that the earth speaks to him, he possesses goodness in this world and justice in the world. ReligionInterpretations of worldly dreams: And whoever sees himself outside the land, this is evidence that he will leave his mother or divorce his wife, and this may be evidence that he will sell one of his homes. But if he sees himself digging the earth and eating dirt in his mouth, this indicates that he will soon obtain huge sums of money. And whoever sees that The earth has opened and an animal has emerged from it, so this is evidence that the dreamer’s death is approaching. Earth: Any land according to its nature and essence. Seeing gathering land indicates hiding secrets and safety from fear, and seeing agricultural land indicates fertility. And whoever dreams that he is in a vast land, then he travels, and the land shows gossip that he cannot hide, and it indicates disagreement or knowledge. Interpretation of the land in a dream by Ibn Shaheen. Daniel said: Her dreams were expressed by a woman. And whoever dreams: that he is in a vast desert land, and this land is not far, then he will travel Soon. And whoever dreams: that he is digging the earth and eating its dirt, he will find money. And whoever sees: that he is digging the earth like a hole or a cellar, then he will take money by cunning and deception. And whoever dreams: that the earth swallowed him, then he will fall into sadness, calamity, misguidance, and affliction, or the woman will destroy his money. And whoever sees: that he has moved from a spacious land to a narrow land, then Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: He is moving from Islam to disbelief. And whoever dreams: that the earth has folded under his feet, it is evidence of the end of his life. And whoever sees: that the earth is trembling, it is fear. And whoever dreams that he has a known land that expands his vision, he will encounter a woman whose danger to people is equal to the extent of the land. And whoever sees that she owns a large, unknown land, it is as low as the capacity of this land, and perhaps it was safe because men were created from it, and perhaps she was a man’s wife. Because it was plowed. And whoever sees that he is in a wide, flat land that he does not know, he will sing. And whoever dreams: that he is sitting on the ground, then he can do it and excel at it, according to the Almighty’s saying: (And you are firm on the ground).
