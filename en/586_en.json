I dreamed of rats entering the house, room, or bed, according to Ibn Sirin. Many people, despite their small size, due to their great ability to hide and their inability to get them out of the house easily, are also carriers of many diseases that can be transmitted to humans through food. Therefore, they are unfavorable and unknown creatures for humans, and seeing mice in a dream carries many associations and symbols. This is what we will learn through our topic today, about the interpretation of seeing mice in a dream in detail. Interpretation of a mouse in a dream In a dream, it is an immoral woman, and it is said that a cursed Jew grieves, or a Jew, or a veil thief, and many mice show her livelihood. Whoever sees a mouse playing in his house It increases his food, because it is found only in a place where there is food. Whoever expels the mouse from his house, his blessings and grace will decrease, and whoever has a mouse has a servant, for the mouse eats what the man eats, and likewise the servant eats what the master eats. And whoever sees a mouse playing in his house will be fruitful. In that year, because the game is only from satiety, and the black and white mouse appears day and night. And whoever sees him in his sleep during the day as he goes and goes in the morning, this indicates his long life, and whoever sees him cutting his clothes, then announces what he missed. And whoever sees a mouse He digs, then he is a thief in a veil, so let him be alert. A mouse is a woman with a bad, rotten bed, and there is no difference between a male and a female. If he sees that he chased something from her or possessed it, then she is also a woman, and mice are women as long as their colors are different. And if he sees a black and white mouse coming and going, he will prolong his life. His age, even white by day and black by night, and they said that the mouse is the home and children. And whoever sees that he has killed a mouse, the bad woman will be victorious. And whoever sees that he has shot a mouse with an arrow, stone, or nut, he will chase an evil woman or write to her badly. And whoever sees that he has If he catches a rat, then he will consult a woman or have sex with her. And whoever sees a lot of rats, white and black, on a slope or an overlook, or in a well, then it is a deficiency in his life. And whoever sees that a rat has come out of his nose or from his organs, then he will have a bad daughter with no good in it. And whoever dreams of seeing us in his house, there is no good in it. And whoever sees a mouse in his clothes or on his bed, it is a woman who interferes with him and there is no good in it. And whoever sees that he has been bitten by the skin of a mouse, a little money will fall on him from a bad woman. Interpretation of rats in a dream according to Imam Al-Sadiq, the interpreter sees. The venerable Sheikh Imam Al-Sadiq said that seeing mice in a dream means that the dreamer will obtain a lot of money in the coming period, and this happens if the mice are in the dreamer’s house. As for seeing mice leaving the dreamer’s house in a dream, this is an indication of little money, and God Almighty knows. Ibn Sirin also believes that the dreamer’s vision of getting rid of a mouse may indicate getting rid of people ",

I dreamed of rats entering the house, room, or bed, according to Ibn Sirin. Many people, despite their small size, due to their great ability to hide and their inability to get them out of the house easily, are also carriers of many diseases that can be transmitted to humans through food. Therefore, they are unfavorable and unknown creatures for humans, and seeing mice in a dream carries many associations and symbols. This is what we will learn through our topic today, about the interpretation of seeing mice in a dream in detail. Interpretation of a mouse in a dream In a dream, it is an immoral woman, and it is said that a cursed Jew grieves, or a Jew, or a veil thief, and many mice show her livelihood. Whoever sees a mouse playing in his house It increases his food, because it is found only in a place where there is food. Whoever expels the mouse from his house, his blessings and grace will decrease, and whoever has a mouse has a servant, for the mouse eats what the man eats, and likewise the servant eats what the master eats. And whoever sees a mouse playing in his house will be fruitful. In that year, because the game is only from satiety, and the black and white mouse appears day and night. And whoever sees him in his sleep during the day as he goes and goes in the morning, this indicates his long life, and whoever sees him cutting his clothes, then announces what he missed. And whoever sees a mouse He digs, then he is a thief in a veil, so let him be alert. A mouse is a woman with a bad, rotten bed, and there is no difference between a male and a female. If he sees that he chased something from her or possessed it, then she is also a woman, and mice are women as long as their colors are different. And if he sees a black and white mouse coming and going, he will prolong his life. His age, even white by day and black by night, and they said that the mouse is the home and children. And whoever sees that he has killed a mouse, the bad woman will be victorious. And whoever sees that he has shot a mouse with an arrow, stone, or nut, he will chase an evil woman or write to her badly. And whoever sees that he has If he catches a rat, then he will consult a woman or have sex with her. And whoever sees a lot of rats, white and black, on a slope or an overlook, or in a well, then it is a deficiency in his life. And whoever sees that a rat has come out of his nose or from his organs, then he will have a bad daughter with no good in it. And whoever dreams of seeing us in his house, there is no good in it. And whoever sees a mouse in his clothes or on his bed, it is a woman who interferes with him and there is no good in it. And whoever sees that he has been bitten by the skin of a mouse, a little money will fall on him from a bad woman. Interpretation of rats in a dream according to Imam Al-Sadiq, the interpreter sees. The venerable Sheikh Imam Al-Sadiq said that seeing mice in a dream means that the dreamer will obtain a lot of money in the coming period, and this happens if the mice are in the dreamer’s house. As for seeing mice leaving the dreamer’s house in a dream, this is an indication of little money, and God Almighty knows.
