Interpretation of dreams: Jinn in a dream symbolizes anxiety and fear of the dreaming jinn and demons. That is, the dreamer has fears of invisible creatures, and thinks about this a lot. Therefore, in his dream, he sees the jinn in terrifying images, and he may see them frightening him, running after him, or harming him, and all of these different situations lead to one path, which is extreme terror that dominates the heart of the viewer. In this case, his psychological state will be the strong reason for seeing this scene. Sometimes seeing the jinn is one of Satan’s tragedies, as it disrupts the life of the fortuneteller, terrifies him, and makes him unable to work or live a normal life due to the constant remembrance of this scene. Al-Nabulsi explained that the appearance of the jinn in a dream shows fraudsters. And thieves, and every human being who relies on evil tricks to obtain interests that are different from people, and if they gather around the fortuneteller in a dream, they mix with people who do not do that. They are good at their knowledge, and they can get money and benefits from it as mercilessly as possible. But when Satan or the jinn is secretive in his words and has a degree of wisdom and sound reason, the vision changes its meaning at that time, and indicates knowledge and increased knowledge. Interpretation of Dreams by Ibn Sirin The symbol of the jinn in The dreamer's dream is a great warning to him that there is a person in his life who does not fear God, practices quackery and sorcery and performs magic on people to harm them and get what he wants. Among them. If a man or woman sees herself transformed into a disgusting jinn in a dream, the dreamer will suffer harm in his life because of this woman and may deal with a man whose intentions are all bad and who wants to do and harm him. A lot of his money. If the dreamer dreams of a jinn sneaking into his house so that he can enter it, the vision is a metaphor for a dangerous thief who wants to harm the people of the house and steal their important things. And if he sees in his dream numbers of jinn invading his house and causing distress to the owners of the house, then they are very cunning and harmful competitors and in reality They enter the dreamer's house with the greatest insolence soon until they expose him and his family to injury. Seeing the genie standing outside the dreamer's house as if he is waiting for something from him, then the dream is about the promises and vows that the dreamer said in the past that he used to fulfill, but he pushed them away from his memory and has not yet implemented them. Interpretation of dreams: jeans for a single religious girl. In reality, if she sees jeans in her dream, this is a message from God warning her of a harmful person hovering around her and watching her who wants to ruin her life or steal her money. But if the dreamer is reckless and stops praying and worshiping God for long periods, then the vision warns her.
