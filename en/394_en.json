Subject: Seeing a blind dead person in a dream. One of the dreams that we constantly see in our dreams, which causes us a great state of anxiety, fear and terror, is to obtain its correct interpretation and find out the reason for the vision that appeared to us in our dreams. Since blindness is one of the difficult things that a person goes through in general life, it is the loss of one of the most important blessings that God gives us sight, and a person can become blind at the beginning of his life. His birth or he may be exposed to a disease or accident that will cause him to lose his sight in public life, but if he sees it, the dreamer will feel a great state of anxiety and confusion in order to obtain its correct interpretation, as the commentator Ibn Sirin interprets it in his performance. Interpretation of dying blind in a dream Blindness in the dead indicates misguidance and wandering. And uncertainty, as they said that the known dead man appears blind or deaf, then in the interpretation it symbolizes an evil that the fortuneteller will end up with and it was said that it is a mistake or a sin. The dreamer of visions does not deserve to follow the blind dead man in a dream, because it indicates bad fate or an unlawful goal. The best thing in a dream is for a dead person to see him after he has been blinded, because in the interpretation it means the return of truth and the disappearance of falsehood or slander.
