            "html": " What are the strongest indicators of a dream about removing an upper molar in a dream? Many believe that the symbol of removing a molar indicates the death of loved ones, whether from the paternal or maternal family, but the vision shows heralds in many cases Sirin and Nabulsi for this vision. Interpretation of a dream about removing an upper molar in a dream A healthy tooth Clean, if the dreamer removes it in a dream, he should expect a bad event that he will witness in reality in his home, knowing that these unpleasant events will be painful for the single and married dreamer as follows:Or not:If in the past the dreamer’s family was closely related and lived together peacefully Because of the availability of love and understanding between them, and he saw in his dream that his upper molar had been removed, this indicates the approaching time of painful disagreements and quarrels. Between family members, knowing that this conflict will be violent and will not be resolved easily and may lead to a complete disruption of the womb relationship. Second: Removing a tooth in a dream and grieving over it is interpreted as separation, and there is no doubt that feelings of separation lead to feelings of sadness and depression, and the interpreters have confirmed This indicator is general to all of the dreamer’s acquaintances, not just his family, meaning that he will leave his fiancée or wife and his relationship with his friend may end. As a result of the separation symbolized by the vision, the next few days will be very difficult for him and full of feelings of loneliness. Third: The vision indicates illness for family members. According to the intensity of the pain felt by the dreamer in the dream, we will know whether this disease is incurable and fatal or not, and most often if the dreamer cries and feels sad after removing that tooth. , a family member will fall ill and die as a result of his illness. The extraction of a molar not only indicates death and sadness, but also enters into symbols of poverty and economic decline in the life of the deity or a person from the family, and it indicates shortages, sudden need, and accumulation of debts. If it appears in the dream that the tooth was not completely removed, but rather part of it was removed, or rather the seal in it was removed and the tooth itself remained, upon alert we go to the dentist to place fillings on the molars that have some defects and need to be repaired, and remove this filling. In a dream, it indicates the following: Whether or not: The dreamer can expose himself in front of people, specifically in front of his family members, if he feels pain in the dream. Second: In the event that the upper molar filling is removed, family secrets that were hidden in waking life will be revealed to him, knowing that they Secretly, they are family men, not women. Unfortunately, they will be bad, and the dreamer may be shocked because of them. Because they will reveal to him what he hides in the souls of some of his family members with hatred, lies, and vile intentions. Third: If the dreamer wants to know something in reality and this thing was invisible to him before, then this mystery will be revealed and will lead to many truths in waking life. Fourth: In fact, filling a tooth is a treatment for it and a way to prevent it from perishing, and if it falls out in a dream, the relationship between the dreamer and one of his family members or relatives will be destroyed even if they are in the dream.
