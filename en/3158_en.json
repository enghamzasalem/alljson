The Holy Kaaba is mentioned in more than A place in the book Interpretation of Dreams, where it was mentioned in the chapter (Interpretation of visions of Hajj and Umrah, the Kaaba, the Black Stone, the Maqam, Zamzam, and what is related to them). Ibn Sirin said: The Kaaba in a dream is a caliph, a prince, or a minister, and the fall of the Kaaba wall indicates the death of the ruler, the state, or the death of the ruler. Seeing the honorable Kaaba in a dream is good news. If the dreamer dreams that the Kaaba is his house or home, then he serves the ruler or resides in his house (his palace) and the state or ministry accepts him.

You are violating the doctrine, belief, and honorable Sunnah of the Messenger of the Prophet. He saw a man as if he crossed the Kaaba, then he narrated it to Sheikh Ibn Shirin, and he said: This is a man who violated the Sunnah of the Prophet and entered into pain. Don’t you see that he is passing by the Qiblah? This was because he allowed himself to pay attention to what was not permissible, so I confirmed Ibn Sirin’s interpretation of it. And whoever dreams in a dream or vision that he touches the Black Stone, then he follows an imam from the people of Hijaz, and misleads the people.
