Interpretation of prayer in a dream by Ibn Sirin. If it appears that he is praying sitting without an excuse, then his work will not be accepted. If He saw that he was praying next to him, he was sick. And if he saw that he was praying while riding, he would be very afraid. And if he dreamed that the imam was praying with the people while he was riding, then if they were in a state of war, they would be helped. If he saw that he was praying in an orchard, then he would ask God for forgiveness. If he dreamed that he He prays on cultivated land, then God will pay his debts from it. And if he sees that he is praying in a pigeon slaughterhouse, this indicates the corruption that he has committed, and it was said: The boy mistreated him. And if he dreams that he missed an obligatory prayer and did not find a place to spend it, then he will not be able to obtain what he deserves. He asks for it. And if he sees that he is praying in straight rows, then they multiply in glorification and glorification of the Almighty’s saying: (And indeed, we are pure, and we are Glory be to Him). And if he sees that he has neglected the obligatory prayer, then he has underestimated some of the laws. Prostrating in a dream is evidence of victory, evidence of repentance from sin, and evidence of earning money. And evidence of longevity, and evidence of freedom from dangers. And if he sees himself worshiping God Almighty on a mountain, then he will gain an invincible man. And if he sees that he is worshiping someone other than God Almighty, his needs will not be satisfied, and he will be breastfed if he is in war, and he will lose if he is a merchant. And if he sees that he He is standing in prayer and does not bow until his time has passed, then he abstains from the obligatory zakat and does not pay it. And if he dreams that he is praying and eating honey, then he will come to his wife while he is fasting. And if he sees that he is sitting in the tashahhud, it will free him from his worries and satisfy his need. And if he sees that he is saying hello and leaving All of his prayers, then he has relieved himself of his worries. If the greeting is on his right and not on his left, then some of his conditions are correct. If the greeting is on his left rather than his right, then some of his conditions are confused. And if he dreams that he is praying to the Kaaba, this indicates the integrity of his religion, and in prayer it indicates That he rejected Islam behind his back by committing some major sins. And if he saw that he was not guided in the direction of the Qiblah, then he was confused about his matter; Because if he prays in a direction other than the qiblah, while wearing white clothes while reading the Qur’an, it is part of the ruling on Hajj. What is required is what God Almighty says: “Wherever they turn, God will direct them.” And if someone who is not an imam sees in his waking hours that he is leading the people in prayer, then the guardianship will be people who deserve honesty and are obedient. And if he sees in their prayer a decrease or increase or a change in his matter, and he is affected by the poverty of the thieves and their misfortunes, then He prayed with them standing while they were sitting: he did not fall.
