Interpretation of a dream about a judge. Whoever sees the judge looks at him with interest and compassion and sympathizes with him. In soft words, its expression is to approach the educated and obtain a high position. And whoever dreams of someone else means despair, want, humiliation, and lack of debts, and it was said: The dream of a famous judge is good and blessed. And whoever sees an unknown judge interprets the Almighty and Most High Creator, and imposes his ruling according to the words of God Almighty: “And God judges.” There is no objection to his ruling.” Ibn Shirin said: Whoever sees that he has become a judge and judge of creation, and is not worthy of it, then he said: If he is not a judge and sees that, harm, affliction, distress, and distress will befall him, and his money and furniture. We will leave. If he is a traveler whose path is interrupted, he will face fatigue and hardship, and his money will be destroyed. And if the sick person sees that the judge has sent him a subpoena, his term may expire. And if the judge sees him sitting next to him or in a high place, this is glory and honor, and perhaps seeing the judge indicates disagreement. And otherwise. Whoever sees a judge with a scale in his hand is judging between creation and reality. Jabir al-Maghribi said: Whoever sees a judge giving a ruling and says it as he saw it. If he sees a judge entering into it, this is glory and the state. Whoever sees in a dream that he committed a crime and then appears before the judge, and is sentenced to imprisonment. In a dream, this indicates difficult or difficult days that the dreamer may soon go through. Whoever sees in his dream that the judge in court orders him to pay alimony to his wife, this could be self-talk if the dreamer is waiting for a decision of this kind. And the woman who sees in her dream That she stands before the judge in a courtroom session and decides to divorce her husband, this indicates that the relationship between them is very close and trusting and that their lives will continue until the end of life with love and tenderness. Whoever sees in his dream that he has become a judge, if he is a merchant, he will achieve destiny and balance. If he sees In a dream that he does not have the right to rule until he rules unjustly among men, then he takes over a matter or a public interest and keeps it for himself, and he may betray trust or deceive a friend. If he is a traveler and sees in his dream that he has assumed judicial authority in the country he is going to, then he will marry people from the people of That state or he takes over their affairs and is right among them. And the judge’s words are the same in the dream as the wise man or the great sheikh. If he sees the scales being weighed before the judge, then he will obtain forgiveness or reward from God. But if he dreams that a judge weighs or weighs money, then this symbolizes the ruler’s bribery and corruption. As for the unknown judge in the dream, he is God Almighty. Whoever dreams that he has become a judge, ruler, sheikh, or jurist, then he occupies a high position among the people, and is affected by many noble deeds. If He saw himself wearing the judge’s dress or dress, or covered with his turban, then he is influenced by power and influence. As for the woman who sees the judge’s face happy and enlightened, if she is unmarried, she will get married. If she is married, then she is promised a livelihood or a child. If she is pregnant, then she will be married. ",
