Ibn Sirin said: If the dreamer cries and tears fall from his eyes without evidence in the dream, it confirms the coming of temptations and distress such as tearing clothes, intense wailing, and slapping the face. If the dream is free of these bad symbols, then it indicates Happiness and happy occasions such as birth, success, promotion, marriage, etc. If the dreamer cries with screams and cries that make people in the dream turn to him and see what he is doing, then he is sad as a result of material or practical losses and may lose the presence of a person in his life, and he feels deep sadness to the point that those around him notice the torment in which he lives. The supplication of the oppressed person in a dream indicates On the return of his right to him and God’s vengeance on the one who insulted him and his sadness over his right that was taken from him. When the dreamer sees in his dream people of his acquaintances or relatives sitting next to him and raising their hands to the Lord of the Worlds to supplicate to Him until the dreamer’s sadness goes away, this is an acceptable supplication. And the dreamer’s life changes from sadness to peace of mind and stability. Praying and crying in a dream according to Al-Nabulsi.
