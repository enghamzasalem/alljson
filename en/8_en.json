            "text": "Seeing a Jubbah (cloak) in a dream means longevity and other interpretations we will explain for the single man, the married man, the pregnant woman, the divorced woman, such as the green or black cloak, or for someone who sees buying his new Jubbah or losing it torn. Or from a dirty cloak or washing my Jubbah for Ibn Sirin and others: Interpretation of the Jubbah in a dream: Seeing a Jubbah in a dream indicates a woman, and if a woman sees it, it means she is betraying her husband, indicating longevity. The cloak in a dream for whoever wears it or buys it or sews it, even if he is poor, makes him rich, because it protects from the cold, which indicates poverty. Whoever meets the Sultan or anyone of high prestige or position, he will gain something from him, and he may be prominent and have money, especially if the Jubbah has a lining, which is the cotton in it. As the lining of the Jubbah shows money, such as treasure and money in the safe. Whoever is single and dreams of a cloak will marry, and the face of his spirit is his wife, and the cotton is her dowry, and the strings are vows and protection. Whoever sees himself sewing a cloak and not wearing it: means that his daughter or son will marry or help in marrying someone else or brings together two people between whom there is separation or a problem, especially if the cloak is not new and is used. and he sees that he is folding it and loving it. Wearing a Jubbah in the summer is the aunt, the wife's mother, religion, illness, restraint, narrowness or hardship for the woman. If he is from the people of war, like a soldier, it means that he will defend his nation and tire his enemy in war. Whoever sees in a dream that he is wearing a Jubbah, then this will come to him from non-Arabs, and if the garment is dyed, he is a friendly boy. If a woman sees the Jubbah and the lining of the Jubbah is mink, she is betraying her husband. The Jubbah in a dream means longevity, and the Jubbah is wealth for its wearer because it prevents the cold, which is poverty, and wearing it in the summer is hardship from a woman, or religion, or illness, or prison, or narrowness, or hardship for the woman. If you dream of a beautiful and soft Jubbah, it means that you will be highly esteemed because of your judgments and beautiful dealings. The ugly Jubbah means misery in your personal affairs. Interpretation of the Jubbah in a dream for Ibn Shaheen: The cloak is interpreted as a woman, and if it is new and clean and white and wide, it indicates the woman's agreement with her husband and good conduct. It was said that wearing a Jubbah in the winter is better. If a woman sees that she is wearing a Jubbah, she will marry if she is single. If she is married, she will have strength, joy and benefit. Seeing the black or blue Jubbah is interpreted through the woman's refusal and disagreement with her husband. Interpretation of the Jubbah in a dream for Ibn Sirin: The scholar Sheikh Muhammad ibn Sirin mentioned in his book \"Tafsir Al-Ahlam Al-Kabira\" that seeing a Jubbah in a man's dream is a sign of a woman. Whoever dreams of wearing a Jubbah may mean that he will marry a non-Arab woman, and seeing a colored or dyed Jubbah indicates and warns of a change in the wife's personality. Interpretation of a cloak in a dream for you are single: For an unmarried girl and the importance of seeing a cloak in her dream, Ibn Sirin passed that an unmarried woman wearing a cloak in her dream symbolizes her purity, chastity and good character, and this also applies to her buying and wearing a black cloak with gold or silver embroidery symbolizes pride and status among people. Seeing a white cloak in a dream portends good fortune and wide fortune or good luck, and the scene of the green cloak is praiseworthy, predicting a year full of all good and desires and aspirations that will come true, God willing. Also, the best vision is to see an unmarried girl in her dream as if she is washing her cloak, this vision portends a happy and important event or the emergence of positive changes in her life. Interpretation of the Jubbah in a married woman's dream: For a married woman who sees in her dream that she is buying a beautiful new embroidered Jubbah, and the dreamer feels joy and happiness, this portends a pregnancy soon, God willing. Seeing a married woman wearing a Jubbah over her clothes symbolizes covering in general, whether it be health or money or gains or children. Seeing the wife wearing a red Jubbah means that she feels strong affection for her husband, and the best vision is to see the white and green Jubbah, because it symbolizes security and prosperity and prosperity and peace. In the closet, or seeing the closet full of Jubbah, a good omen in general for the husband and wife, especially if the wife sees the Jubbah in a wide sleeve. Interpretation of the Jubbah in a pregnant woman's dream: As for the pregnant woman, the interpretation does not change much from what was mentioned earlier, the Jubbah portends security and safety for the pregnant woman and her fetus, and seeing the pregnant woman in a dream as if her husband is giving her a gift. It contains a white embroidered Jubbah, which prophesies the birth of a female. Interpretation of the Jubbah in a man's dream: We have previously mentioned that seeing a Jubbah in a man's dream, whether he is single or married, symbolizes a woman and refers to her directly. Because a single man seeing a Jubbah in his dream indicates a woman close to his heart or his mother, and seeing a red or pink or purple Jubbah symbolizes a friend and lover. The man does not deserve to see a yellow Jubbah in his dream, it portends fatigue, misery and troubles that will remain for one of the women, and seeing a black Jubbah shows the man's enjoyment of intelligence and intelligence and gentleness and dignity. And prestige, especially if he sees that he is getting it from a president or king. \n"
