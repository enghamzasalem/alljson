If he sees fire coming out of his hand, this means that he earns his living on a forbidden day, or that he is ignorant of the source of his money and does not look at it. Whoever sees in a dream that he is eating fire: he is eating prohibited money, or eating the rights of orphans.

An article that we will learn about the interpretation of fire in a dream on a different website. Interpretation of a dream about fire according to Nabulsi. Seeing fire in a dream with Nabulsi indicates two conflicting things. The vision can be a sign of reward, it can also be a sign of punishment, it can be a sign of goodness that will happen, and it can be a warning of an upcoming danger. Also, seeing fire indicates the outbreak of conflicts and wars between people over purely worldly matters. As for seeing someone driving fire, it means It symbolizes sustenance, tranquility, comfort, and establishing close relationships with those who are famous for their high status and high rank. Also, seeing fire indicates the light of knowledge and the tendency to acquire knowledge and master the arts. Imam Nabulsi says: “Whoever sees his house burning, this indicates his dissatisfaction with himself and his attempt to change what is in it.” Whoever sees fire in front of his hands, this indicates that he was wrong and that his actions are watching him and that he is corrupt and does not look to God in his work. If he sees fire coming out of his hand, this means that he earns his living on a forbidden day, or that he is ignorant of the source of his money and does not look at it. Whoever sees in a dream that he is eating fire: he is eating prohibited money, or eating the rights of orphans. Interpretation of a dream about fire: If one sees a burning fire anywhere around him and loud noises, this means that his life will be completely destroyed. If the dreamer sees a fire burning his clothes, this indicates The emergence of evil, hatred, and the spread of disputes among people. The same previous vision also shows the wasting of money and wasting it easily and on useless things. If there is thick smoke and audible sounds of fire, this is evidence of torment, rebellion, and great destruction. Interpretation of dreams of fire and extinguishing. To see yourself extinguishing fires symbolizes peace. And the return of water to its natural course, the end of crises and problems, and the end of strife. If the extinguished fire is an attribute of the hearth or places that feed people, this means poverty, poverty, lack of conditions, and many economic crises. The same vision portends a permanent postponement of any plans or the suspension of many works. For another period. If he sees that he is extinguishing the fire, this means that he will be in a state of despair and great disappointment. What is the interpretation of extinguishing a fire in a dream? If the fire is very great and great and you see that you extinguished it, then you are the cause or cause of the divine reasons that God used to save and end the trials Extinguishing a fire in a dream also means alleviating fatigue, alleviating suffering and hardship, and gradually and successfully improving circumstances. If you light a fire but the wind or rain causes it to go out, this symbolizes that things are not going the way you want them to. The vision is a message to the seeker not to give up and to continue his journey. Equally. Interpretation of a dream about a stove and fire: Seeing a stove and fire means that you are planning something that could be good or it could be disgusting and harmful. "
