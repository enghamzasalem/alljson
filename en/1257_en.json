            "html": " A dream about losing the abaya of a single, married, pregnant or divorced woman. Interpretation of losing an abaya in a dream: In general, the abaya, if lost in a dream, indicates the fiancé or husband leaving his wife. Whoever sees in a dream that she has lost her abaya, this symbolizes turning away from religion and then returning to it. A dream indicates The lost abaya indicates the problems and difficulties that the dreamer will face, but he will get rid of them. This dream indicates that the husband will travel for a long time in the event of the dreamer’s marriage. The loss of the abaya sometimes symbolizes the divorce of the woman if she is married. In the event of a woman’s divorce, the abaya is lost and found again, this indicates That she will return to her husband or marry another. For an unmarried woman, losing a cloak in a dream indicates fear, abundant anxiety, and thinking about the future. If she finds the missing abaya, this indicates that her marriage is imminent. Losing an abaya in a dream indicates the dreamer’s feeling of confusion, especially with regard to decisions and choices in life. An unmarried woman who dreams of losing her toys, and the dream ends without her finding them, means that there is a problem that is bothering her and delaying her marriage. God Almighty says (They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them). It indicates marriage and its loss, and perhaps a delay in marriage or rejection of the engagement by someone. The abaya indicates piety, as God Almighty says (and wearing piety is better). The abaya is a covering and purity, and its loss may be a flaw in wearing the legitimate hijab, or inappropriateness, or a deficiency in religion. The same applies to a married woman, who may be concerned with the burdens of the house and children. I conclude that this is a burden. On the contrary, there may be negligence on the part of the husband. It may also indicate a lot of discussion about the mistakes of others. Losing a woman’s abaya and losing it and not finding it means divorce, and if she divorces him and he finds her and tries to return her, it means returning to her ex-husband, but if it is an irrevocable divorce and he finds her after hardship, its meaning God willing, he will marry another woman, or he will reach a stage of psychological stability and reassurance after the suffering. Losing the abaya and shoes in a dream expresses a feeling of confusion in choosing the appropriate life partner. Interpretation of losing the abaya in a dream. As for a woman who sees that she has lost her abaya, forgotten, stolen, or lost in a dream, This is a sign of the arrival of worries and misfortunes, and an unmarried or unmarried girl who sees in her dream that they have occurred.
