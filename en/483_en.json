The imam also explained that drinking unsweetened alcohol in a dream indicates illicit money that the dreamer obtains by doing illegal things, He also oppresses people and does not give them their rights. When a dreamer sees in a dream that he drinks large quantities, it symbolizes that he feels confused about something, and this has caused him states of anxiety and panic that affect his practice in life. If someone drinks slander in a dream and does not He influences him, but claims the opposite, so it is interpreted that he is not telling the truth, but rather deceiving people and causing them great problems, and God must repent. Of these bad deeds.But whoever is close to God in reality and sees in a dream that he drank wine and did not drink, then this is a good sign that the situation is changing and leading to the goals of God’s command and that the dreamer will increase his obedience to God. If the dreamer is in a high position and sees that he is drunk, this is a sign that he is losing his status among people due to his bad behavior. Drinking alcohol in a dream after drinking it indicates a group of events that will change the course of things in the dreamer’s life. When the dreamer pours wine into water and drinks it In a dream, it means that he is doing illegal work to earn money and that God will not bless him for what he gets. Drinking alcohol in a dream for a single womanDrinking alcohol in a dream for a single woman leads to many changes that will occur in the dreamer’s life, and God knows best, especially in the case of Not getting drunk. If a girl dreams that she is drinking alcohol and does not get drunk, this indicates her closeness to a good man and she will be happy with this person and her life with him. This dream can also symbolize that the dreamer has many ambitions that she is trying to reach and will be achieved. "
