Then we talked in the previous topic about the definition of daydreams, and today we will talk about daydreams in psychology. We hope you like the previous topic and we are trying hard to make you like this topic as well. Daydreams Daydreams differ from the dreams we see in our sleep in that they are images, fantasies, and wishes that we want to achieve and pursue while we are free and feel pleasure and happiness. Instead, we delve into the details of these dreams as if we were watching this movie, if we look at them from a positive perspective, and they can motivate us to fulfill desires that cannot be achieved. One of the positive aspects of daydreaming is that it keeps us away from the stress that arises from the pressures of life, we imagine things We love it and hope that it will happen, and at the same time we forget a little about our reality, especially if it is a reality in which individual life is painful and not considered a pathological condition. They are just fantasies that come to a person in his free time and wish him in this life, and there are many examples of geniuses and creative people who dreamed of these dreams since childhood and made these dreams come true. Therefore, we must take advantage of this state of creativity, develop our talents, and increase our awareness.

The condition in which these dreams dominate a person’s thinking and accompany them most of the time - so that they are unable to go out, work, study, or live their lives normally and mix with their families and friends - is considered an indication of a pathological condition that must be monitored by a psychiatrist. Because it can reach the point of obsession and imagine negative and irrational things, in which the person becomes introverted and isolated from the world, immersed in his fantasies that are far from reality. Rather, it can lead to the complete destruction of his life, and this situation can arise when a person is exposed to a situation that is difficult to bear, so he resorts to isolation from society in order to unleash his imagination in matters that he believes. It will make him forget the difficult reality in which he lives and which he cannot overcome. This condition can make a person not distinguish between reality and imagination, and thus enter a state that makes him hallucinate and lose control of his thinking. Therefore, it is important to treat this condition to return the person to normal, and help him overcome the crisis that caused it ",
