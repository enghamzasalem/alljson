How did Ibn Sirin, Al-Nabulsi, and the jurisprudence scholars explain this vision? Is seeing one mouse different from seeing a large number of mice? What is the difference in meaning between a white mouse and a black mouse? Next article.Do you have a confusing dream? what are you waiting for; Google is an Egyptian site for interpreting dreams. Interpretation of seeing mice in a dream. Al-Nabulsi said that the mouse is an evil symbol because it indicates a woman with bad morals. From here we explain several sub-interpretations that emerge from the basic interpretation mentioned above, and they are as follows: Or not: Whoever dreams that his wife has become like a mouse, then this is a message from God warns him about his wife, as she is a jealous and hateful woman with bad morals and can harm him in his life. Second: If a single person dreams that he chased a black rat from his house, then she is an immoral girl who wanted to marry him, but God does not want to harm him, and will save him from the evil of this Girl, and perhaps the dream can be interpreted as the dreamer protecting himself from sins and immorality and expelling from his life a woman who wanted to commit adultery with him. Third: If the dreamer sees that her workplace is full of rats, then she is surrounded by a large number of bad colleagues who deal with her, and she should not provide for them.
