            "html": " Interpretation of a dream about oil in a dream by Ibn Sirin: Seeing oil in a dream is one of the visions around which there is a lot of controversy for many reasons, as not all oils are of the same grade, as we find that there is a big difference between the types of oil and depending on the raw materials they are made of, as well as depending on the use. It can be a cooking oil, hair oil or conditioner. Therefore, we find that the interpretations differed somewhat, but what does it mean to see oil in general? Interpretation of a dream about oil in a dream: Oil symbolizes a simple person who does not know how to twist and who is easy to confront without feeling ashamed or anxious, or a person who looks at things simply, and obstacles do not prevent him. ​​He achieves his goals, problems do not spoil his life, and he does not allow anything to disturb his mood. It also indicates the dreamer’s secret desire to wake up one day to find that all worries, obsessions, and complex issues have been forgotten and that his life will begin again without difficulties or bad psychological pressures. If the oil he saw in his dream was massage oil, then this indicates calm, comfort, and the emotions raging inside him that he wants to show to his life partner. But if he saw oil, this is a sign of wealth, profit, and making new investment deals. The vision is also a warning to the pioneer against wasting money. Or it is spent on useless things. Oil can be a cure for a disease, a cure for toxins, or a good and blessing. It is said that oil can symbolize a person’s surname or the name of a city that people frequent. For example, in the country of Egypt, there is the city of Kafr El-Zayat, and there are families called Al-Zayat, and therefore the oil in a dream could be a reflection of the daily events that the viewer experiences, and the subconscious mind was interested in storing them and bringing them out in the form of symbols. Seeing it indicates insight, and moving on the right path. And following the light that comes from righteousness and piety. Al-Nabulsi believes that consuming oil may indicate the presence of a malicious act or sorcery. However, if the fortuneteller drinks olive oil, this is a sign of lawful money, long life, health, seeking knowledge, and performing duties. Bad oil, if it is sluggish or spoiled, indicates On non-compliance, tendency toward taboos, and failure to fulfill promises. However, if spoiled oil turns into well-made oil, this indicates an unstable state, purity, and goodness. Praiseworthy possession and transactions. It is said that seeing baby oil in a dream symbolizes that the dreamer has become immersed in life and its pursuits, forgetting himself and neglecting the joyful voice of the child within him, and therefore needs to take a vacation or leave to travel, to rest. And enjoy your time away from the pressures of work and endless demands. According to Miller’s Encyclopedia, we find the following: Oil indicates high status, power, and high places.
