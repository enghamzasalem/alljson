Ibn Sirin says in the great book Interpretation of Dreams: “Your dream that you have a stick in your hand is evidence that you will seek the help of a strong man and obtain what you ask for and triumph over your enemy, and perhaps your wealth of power and status may increase.” “. If the stick breaks, this indicates self-destruction, oppression, and defeat, and this indicates the loss of money. Visions of the stick as if it broke, if he was a merchant, he lost, and if he was tyrannical, then he was humiliated. Then the thrown stick is interpreted as a malicious, hypocritical man, because its origin is wood. Who dreams that He hits a stone with his stick and water flows from it. And if he is poor, then he is rich. And whoever dreams that he is leaning on his stick, then he is leaning on an honorable man. Whoever dreams that he is leaning on a stick will find what he is looking for with the help of an honest person. The stick in a married woman’s dream. The stick in a dream A married woman or her dream indicates the husband’s integrity and success in this world and religion, and it is an indication of the elimination of problems and the disappearance of worries. The stick in a dream for a single girl or girl. The stick in a single woman’s dream may indicate the strength of her character and it may indicate the presence of a strong person who protects or defends her. The stick In a dream about pregnancy, I searched for a long time in dream interpretation dictionaries looking for an explanation of the stick in a pregnant woman’s dream, but I did not find anything significant except what was said in the interpretation of the stick about the girl. Or a pregnant married woman can indicate a male child because he is solid and strong, and this interpretation is also supported by Freud’s vision in interpreting the stick for a woman, but we do not have enough space here to delve into this analysis, but I will return later when we devote a chapter to analytical psychology on the Dream Interpretation website. Beating with a stick in a dream. Beating with a stick benefits the person subject to the act. The husband who hits his wife with a stick gives her something or gives birth to a male child.

Interpretation of seeing Moses’ staff in a dream. Moses’ staff in a dream symbolizes the power of Almighty God. On transforming things from bad to good, and we all know the story of our master Moses when God asked him (And what is this in your right hand Moses (17)) and he said: “It is my staff on which I lean and I break it over my sheep and I have no choice over it (18) He said: Moses threw it.” (20) ) He said: Take it and do not be afraid. We return it to its beginning. By the Qur’anic text, we understand that Moses’ staffs symbolize good management and stewardship, because Moses went from a shepherd of sheep to a shepherd for the people of Israel, bringing them from the tyranny of slavery to a land where God is worshipped. Therefore, we cannot interpret it in the vision. The staff of Moses is viewed as a magic wand, rather it is a symbol of God's staff. Strength, will, and will. Interpretation of the scepter in a dream: The scepter in a dream represents a reckless boy, and it was said: Rather, he is a pretentious man. Whoever sees that he is hitting the ball with a stick, he is fighting with a woman or an actor. The scepter comes from the jinn and seeing it indicates war and harm. Whoever sees that he has a mace in his hand with which he can strike, then he will obtain what he seeks without being sound.
