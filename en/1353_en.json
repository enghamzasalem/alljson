The vision is considered repulsive and in this article we take a look at all the signs and situations in more detail and explanation.

Interpretation of a dream about prison by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin believes that prison is interpreted in more than one way. It interprets evil people, harm, severe illness, imprisonment from work, getting out of bed, and falling. In conspiracies and the grave, the jailer is therefore interpreted as the grave. Prison also symbolizes the world and its conditions, growing up in it, pursuing desires, and following temptations.

The Prophet of God, Joseph, gives this interpretation in his story (peace be upon him). What does imprisonment mean in a single woman’s dream? Ibn Shaheen believes that the interpretation of a dream about imprisonment for an unmarried woman indicates marriage to a man famous for his qualities and morals, respected in his knowledge and position, and moving to a new place, benefiting from previous experiences and the ability to do so.
