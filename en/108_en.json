It has many colors and different sizes, and today we will learn about its various connotations by quoting the opinions of dream interpretation scholars about it. Seeing a belt in a dream for single women, married women, and pregnant women with all the details.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

The interpretation of seeing a belt in a dream is a matter of dispute among scholars, and opinions differ depending on the details of the vision. Some translators, such as Al-Nabulsi, said that seeing a belt in a dream It shows the firmness and stability of the visionary, as he never backs down from a decision he made, even if it seems to him that he was wrong. The vision may also indicate extreme care and unwillingness to spend for fear of the future, but this care eventually turns into extreme scarcity that causes psychological harm to the wife. And children if the dreamer is married. Al-Nabulsi also said that it is an indication of the dreamer’s intention to leave his country and go to another place in search of a lawful livelihood. As for Ibn Sirin, he saw that the belt indicates the difficulties that the dreamer is going through and that he is living a difficult stage in his life. Others said that seeing it It expresses the extent of confusion in which the visionary finds himself and his inability to make an appropriate decision regarding important matters in his life. If a girl sees this vision and wears a belt in her dream, she is experiencing extreme tension for someone who may propose to her, while she desires to communicate with another person, which It makes her very confused between what her heart desires. For her and what satisfies her mind.
