We will interpret it for the single, married, pregnant, divorced woman and the man, such as seeing someone swimming in the pool or in the sea or in the lake or swimming in it. A pool or in the lake, or I dreamed that I was swimming with people for my son, Sirin and Imam Al-Sadiq and others in the continuation of the topic: Interpretation of swimming in a dream Seeing swimming in a dream in general indicates success in love or study, as well as success in work, or success in general in all matters of life, especially if swimming is easy. And swimming in a dream indicates good family ties, and indicates wealth and abundance of sustenance, especially if swimming in clear water.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

If one sees himself drowning while swimming or that the water he is swimming in is unclean, this indicates failure or crisis for the visions.

If you dream of swimming, it means good news, success, if you love to swim, and if you dream that you are drowning while swimming, it means you will suffer a lot of worries and problems. Swimming is a praiseworthy vision for whoever sees himself well in good swimming, and whoever sees that he has gone swimming for those who are good in the dream means that he will engage in something and be successful in it.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

And if one of the leaders expressed his desire to swim in murky waters in his dream, this means that he will wage war against his counterpart. But if he sees himself crossing the sea in a dream, this means that he will surely overcome this leader. If the researcher sees himself swimming in the sea, this means that he will gain more knowledge and increase his knowledge.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

If one dreams that he crosses the valley by swimming to the desired place, this is a clear indication that he will have to submit to one of the tyrannical rulers, but God Almighty will protect him. And if one dreams that he is swimming in the open sea or in its depths, this means that he will embark on an ambitious mission and shine.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

And if the dreamer sees himself walking on water, this is evidence that he is strong, receives proof or confirmation of something, and relies on his Lord to embark on a journey full of dangers. Interpretation of swimming in a dream for Ibn SirinThe dream interpreter Muhammad ibn Sirin says that swimming is praiseworthy and good and shows self-confidence, and seeing swimming in a well in the middle of the sea in a dream indicates an increase in knowledge. Seeing swimming on land is unacceptable and may indicate imprisonment. As for swimming in a valley with little running water and reaching the other side, this indicates that you will benefit, especially if you have a problem with the authorities. Seeing swimming with a feeling of drowning is a sign that you are facing problems in life. And when you see that you are swimming with your enemy, this is a symbol of victory. But if you see that you are swimming professionally, this symbolizes that you are facing your past problems and emotions and sorrows with confidence and strength, which means that one day you will be able to overcome the internal depression you are living in. Swimming in a dream also indicates that you are an ambitious person who is confident in his abilities in life and his attractiveness on an emotional and social level. If you see one of your children swimming in a dream, this indicates your concern for his future and your fear that he will drown in life in problems and difficulties that he may not be able to escape from. If you see that you are learning to swim, it means that you are making an effort to continue or adapt to a new environment. And if you see in a dream that you are swimming against the current, it means that you are facing the pressures and opinions you face in reality. Check again that your choices are in the right place. If you see that you are swimming with one or more other people, it means that you share the same feelings or the same projects and aspirations. Diving or swimming underwater means that you will enter into new relationships. And if the seawater is not clean, this indicates a problem that you will face in the near future, and if there are leftover garbage in the sea, this indicates that you are worried about one of your friends. Interpretation of swimming in a dream for Ibn ShaheenHe says whoever dreams that he swims and then quarrels with his opponent and defeats him and defeats him, and whoever sees that he swims in the water, he escaped from him before he noticed his sleep, this indicates his kindness from his concern. Sleeping while swimming in water, and whoever dreams that he walks on a river or sea, this indicates the soundness of faith and good religion, as it is said that swimming is a confirmation of a matter for its owner, which he doubts, and if he is about to travel, then this trip is in danger. If a scholar dreams that he is swimming in the sea, his knowledge has reached what he needs, and if he dreams that he is floating in a wide valley until he reaches the place he wants, this indicates that he is interfering in the actions of a tyrannical, unjust ruler, and if the scholar sees himself floating on the ground, then this dream warns the scholar of imprisonment, and he lives in his prison according to the ease of swimming or the difficulty of swimming, and according to the strength of the scholar in swimming.atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

            "text": "## The Surah of An-Nur (The Light) in a Dream\n\n**General Interpretation**\nReciting the Holy Quran and pondering the meanings of its verses is an important act of worship that illuminates the soul and fills the heart with humility and faith.  Surah An-Nur is particularly considered to be a Surah with great reward. Persistence in reading or listening to it brings blessings and joy.  There are many interpretations for this dream, which we will explore below.\n\n**Expert Interpretations**\nExperts interpret seeing Surah An-Nur in a dream as a sign of abundant provision. The dreamer will experience plentiful blessings and prosperity in their life, alongside improved health and recovery from illness. God will grant them healing and well-being, enabling them to work diligently, provide for their family, and achieve their aspirations, by God's will. \n\nIf the dreamer recites Surah An-Nur, or hears it recited, it indicates their piety, righteousness, and dedication to drawing closer to God. They are committed to promoting good and forbidding evil, abstaining from sins and transgressions. God rewards them with peace, tranquility, and success in their endeavors.\n\n**Ibn Sirin's Interpretation**\nIbn Sirin considered seeing Surah An-Nur in a dream a positive sign. If one sees themselves reading Surah An-Nur, it indicates that they are righteous, praising God, and seeking closeness to Him through piety and good deeds.  God will send light into their heart, granting them prosperity, ease, and happiness in their life. This dream also signifies that their grave will be illuminated, paving their path to Paradise, by God's will. It further suggests that they will achieve a high level of knowledge and approach matters with wisdom and reason, becoming a leader in their field.\n\nIf the dreamer feels confused and lost in their life, seeing Surah An-Nur suggests that God will guide them and illuminate their path. This dream encourages them to follow Islamic law and the Prophet's teachings in all aspects of their life. Conversely, if the dreamer is on a path of delusion and prohibited acts, seeing Surah An-Nur symbolizes divine grace and sincere repentance. God will enable them to guide others and teach them the fundamentals of Islam, earning them rewards in this life and the hereafter.\n\n**An-Nabulsi's Interpretation**\nImam An-Nabulsi clarified that seeing Surah An-Nur indicates that the dreamer's life will improve for the better. God will enlighten their mind and perception, making them wiser and more balanced in dealing with matters. As a result, they will receive great rewards, and God will illuminate their grave.  \n\nHe concluded his interpretations by explaining that this vision is a good omen of repentance, drawing closer to God, refraining from sin and impurities, embracing obedience and good deeds, and achieving peace of mind.\n\n**Seeing Surah An-Nur in an Unmarried Woman's Dream**\nSeeing Surah An-Nur in an unmarried woman's dream is a very positive vision. It suggests that her life will be blessed with justice, completeness, and abundant goodness. Her dreams and desires will be fulfilled by God's will, thanks to her commitment to performing obligatory acts of worship, her good character, and virtuous qualities.  Some interpreters say that hearing Surah An-Nur recited in her dream signifies good health, God knows best.\n\nIf she sees herself reading Surah An-Nur with reverence and weeping, it indicates the strength of her faith and her fear of God's judgment and punishment.  She fears God in her actions, constantly assists the poor and needy, avoids suspicion, possesses strong faith and noble morals, and will experience happiness, security, and tranquility. \n\n**Seeing Surah An-Nur in a Married Woman's Dream**\nIf a married woman is seeking pregnancy and using all means to achieve motherhood but has not yet conceived, seeing herself listening to Surah An-Nur alongside her husband is a promising sign of impending pregnancy and a blessed child. God will bestow upon her offspring good health, and they will be known for their good conduct among people. \n\nIf she is struggling financially, burdened with worries and responsibilities, and unable to provide for her family, the dream carries good news of abundant provision, blessings, and prosperity in her life. God will guide her husband to a profitable job, increasing their financial standing and enabling them to achieve their desired goals.\n\n**Seeing Surah An-Nur in a Pregnant Woman's Dream**\nSurah An-Nur delivers a comforting message to a pregnant woman who might be experiencing health issues or emotional distress due to her fear for the baby and her constant desire for reassurance. This dream signifies that she will pass through this period safely, with significant improvement in her health, leading to a period of stability and peace of mind. God willing, she will have a smooth delivery, free from obstacles and severe physical pain.\n\nSeeing Surah An-Nur is a sign that she will have a healthy baby boy. It is also favorable if the dreamer reads Surah An-Nur themselves, engages with its verses, and reflects on its meaning. This will help them overcome the issues that cloud their life, causing them distress and sorrow. If they face financial hardship, they will overcome it, and their life will be filled with material abundance. \n\n**Seeing Surah An-Nur in a Divorced Woman's Dream**\nIf a divorced woman is struggling with difficulties and conflicts in her life, causing her to feel fear and anxiety about the challenging circumstances that may lie ahead, seeing Surah An-Nur in a dream is an auspicious omen. It signifies that her affairs will be eased, her burdens lifted, and her circumstances transformed for the better. She will also experience good health after years of illness and hardship.\n\nSurah An-Nur is a message for her to persevere with patience and strong faith, enabling her to overcome the challenges she faces, bringing greater calm and stability to her life. She will also experience abundant provision, blessings, and goodness in her life, paving the way for success and the fulfillment of her long-held goals. \n"
