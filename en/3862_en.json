The scholar Ibn Sirin interpreted seeing hair loss in a dream as a loss of money. And loss during hair loss. The dream also symbolizes the worries that the dreamer is going through in the current period, especially if this loss turns into baldness. Al-Nabulsi interpreted this to mean that hair in a dream is a source of anxiety that he suffers from, and the poor and the rich increase. If the poor person sees that his hair is falling out, this indicates On the collapse of some of his worries, and from the back of the head, this indicates the delay in the appearance of a certain thing, and God knows best. Seeing a bald person in a dream means that the dreamer is being deceived, but if the bald person is truly dead, then this symbolizes his need for charity and begging.

Beating a bald person in a dream is an indication that the dreamer will provide assistance to a person in debt. He sees himself sitting with a bald person whom he does not know, so the dream indicates the loss of his money and the deterioration of his health. However, if the dreamer sees that his brother is bald, this symbolizes his need for support and aid.
