It should also be noted here that the dream of pregnancy for newlyweds without children is real or comes true through the appearance of praiseworthy names. Such as the name Sadiq, Ahmed, Mabrouk, Khairuddin, Hafez and other names that make the vision strong and clear. This dream also applies if a married woman sees in a dream, as if the doctor told her that she was pregnant or a friend or neighbor told her.
