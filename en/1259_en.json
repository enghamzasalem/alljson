The piercing is an indication of advice or a will or the presence of something that the individual needs to know in particular or symbols in his life that they need to decipher. And if the piercing is in his right ear, this indicates his benefit in the afterlife and good neighborliness and knowledge of good news and the application of the will that he conveyed to one of his relatives. True, but in this world and not in the future. And if the fortune teller sees that the piercing of his ear is heavy, it is a sign of injustice, whether in the will he wrote, or in the trust he has, or in the division of his rights.
