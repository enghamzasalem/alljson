            "text": "Seeing rabies in a dream refers to hostility, conflict, and other interpretations. We will interpret it for the single girl, the married woman, the pregnant woman, the divorced woman, and the man, such as a dream about a dog bite or a puppy bite, or a dog biting his left hand, or someone barking like a dog according to Ibn Sirin and others in: Interpretation of rabies in a dream Rabies can appear in people who have been bitten by a dog, so what does its appearance in a dream mean? If you dream that you have rabies in the dream, it represents deep-seated hostility that could erupt into violence unless it is expressed in a controlled way. And if you are infected with rabies in the dream, this symbolizes tension or anger, and proves that the problems you will face will make you feel helpless in the coming period. If you see that you are infected with rabies, this means that your family will not support you, which will make you feel insecure. Being infected with rabies in your dream means that your boss will belittle you and will not show you the respect you deserve, and things will not get better with your family either, so you will have a desire to go to a place where no one knows you to start over. atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://tinyplywood.com/472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d/invoke.js\"></scr' + 'ipt>'); Dreaming of another person suffering from rabies And this dream indicates that the people around you do not accept you because your attitudes and beliefs make you different from others because other people's philosophies will be strange to you and you will find them boring and impersonal. If you dream that you are infected with rabies, this means that one of your family members will disappoint you, and you may realize how your partner is not the same person you fell in love with, or you will find out that your friend tried to deceive you, in any case, the next period will be really difficult and you will have to make some changes to adapt to the current situation. Dreaming of other people suffering from rabies indicates a conflict with a very stubborn person, and a sign that you will try to explain your actions to a family member, but they will not understand you because they will think you have made a serious mistake and that you should fix it as soon as possible. atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

On the one hand, you want to satisfy yourself, but on the other hand, you are afraid of being judged by people, you have to think everything over and decide if the relationship with this person is worth the sacrifice. When things become clearer, you will know what to do. If you dream of another person being treated for rabies, the dream in which you see people being treated for rabies symbolizes panic and you probably did not complete some work on time, so deadlines are now stressing you, you do not know how to complete them and you regret postponing some commitments for a long time wondering where you spent that precious time. Interpretation of fighting with someone infected with rabies in a dream If you are arguing with an angry person in a dream, it means that you will do something dirty, for example, you may accuse a colleague or friend of spreading lies about you and you will not want to listen to their arguments. You will be convinced that everything bad that happened is because of them and it will take you a long time to understand that you were wrong, as you will have to apologize for seriously insulting them with your accusations. atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

You are fighting a lot because of it and you don't want to accept the truth, but you see everything from your point of view. If you don't change something, you could lose the people who are very important to you. Interpretation of killing someone infected with rabies in a dream The dream in which you kill a rabid person means that you are a very kind person and that being exposed to any kind of human pain hurts you deeply. You are also more sensitive when it comes to the elderly, sick, and poor people you meet on the streets every day, and to overcome this sensitivity, start volunteering for some charitable work. This way you will know that you are doing everything you can to help those who need it most, and God knows best. atOptions = { 'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d', 'format' : 'iframe', 'height' : 250, 'width' : 300, 'params' : {} }; document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

The finger in a dream indicates a son, spouse, father, mother, money, or wealth. Whoever sees that his fingers have grown large, then this is good, for this indicates an increase in money and livelihood, and a decrease in money.<br/>Perhaps the cutting off of a finger in a dream indicates that you will not benefit from the father or from the mother or from the children, or it indicates that the money will go away, or that his work will be disrupted, or that his trade will fail.</p>\n<p>Fingers may indicate the king's deputies, who differ in their ranks and advantages. Whoever sees himself biting his fingers in a dream, then his disease will die.<br/>And whoever sees his fingers cut off or infected with some disease, this indicates weakness in his soldiers or children, or relatives or acquaintances.<br/>Perhaps fingers refer to the five prayers, so the thumb is for <a href=\"https://gptafser.com/post/تفسير-صلاة-الفجر-في-المنام?page=3211\" >Fajr prayer</a>, the index finger is for <a href=\"https://gptafser.com/post/تفسير-صلاة-الظهر-في-المنام?page=2782\" >Zuhr prayer</a>, the middle finger is for <a href=\"https://gptafser.com/post/تفسير-صلاة-العشاء-في-المنام-لابن-سيرين?page=826\" >Isha prayer</a>, the middle finger is at sunset, and the little finger is for Isha. He said: \"The middle one is for <a href=\"https://gptafser.com/post/تفسير-صلاة-الفجر-في-المنام?page=3211\" >Fajr prayer</a> because it is recommended to lengthen it, and the little finger is for <a href=\"https://gptafser.com/post/تفسير-صلاة-الظهر-في-المنام?page=2782\" >Zuhr prayer</a>, and the little finger is for Asr prayer because it is the end of the day. And if the fingers are money, then the nails are zakah, and if the fingers are soldiers, then the nails are weapons and their number.</p>\n<p>And the fingers hold money, and the fingers are days or months or years. Perhaps the fingers refer to the children of the brother and the shoulder is the brother.  And the fingers are in the state of the children and they are money.<br/>Whoever sees that his finger is cut off and then his money is harmed, and what is done with the fingers of righteousness or corruption is related to duty or to the brother, and the length of the fingers indicates an increase.  In greed.<br/>If he sees a finger that grew on his fingers, then this is an increase in his relatives, in his prayer, or in his knowledge.<br/>And if he sees that one of his fingers has moved to another place, then he delays prayer for the next time.<br/>Whoever sees: that he folded his fingers, then he gathered his prayers together.  Perhaps his relatives have gathered together for a matter to consult and cooperate, and it is said that the fingers are interlocked without working with them with a handclasp, and it is said that they indicate connection, or closeness and compactness.  Perhaps this indicates the cancellation of movement and prayer.  And it is said: The fingers of the right hand are the five prayers, and their shortening indicates negligence and laziness in them, and their length indicates the persistence of prayer, and the fall of one of them indicates the abandonment of prayer.<br/>Whoever sees: as if he had bitten a man's fingernails, then this indicates the bad behavior of the one who bit him.<br/>Whoever sees: as if milk comes out of his thumb, and blood comes out of his index finger and he drinks from them, then he is on his wife's mother or sister, and breaking the fingers indicates the occurrence of bad words. From his relatives.<br/>And if the imam sees an increase in his fingers, then this indicates an increase in greed and oppression and the absence of justice, and the fingers of the left hand are the children of the brother and sister, and drawing the fingers of men with henna indicates a lot. Praise, and drawing the fingers of a woman with henna indicates the kindness of her husband to her, and her husband does not show his love for her.</p>\n<p><span></span></p><div class=\"angwp_84394 _ning_cont _ning_hidden _ning_outer _align_center responsive\" data-aid=\"0\" data-bid=\"84394\" data-size=\"custom\" style=\"max-width:100%; width:100%;height:inherit;\"><div class=\"_ning_label _left\" style=\"\"></div><div class=\"_ning_inner\" style=\"\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tatOptions = {\n\t\t'key' : '472468d31e6ce122aa89df85d9772b6d',\n\t\t'format' : 'iframe',\n\t\t'height' : 250,\n\t\t'width' : 300,\n\t\t'params' : {}\n\t};\n\tdocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?
