Or jihad, asceticism, worship, knowledge, charity, attachment, or patience in the face of perdition. Whoever dreams of entering the afterlife and seeing what is in it, the dream is for one who does good deeds with knowledge and skill, and shows laziness and evil.

Whoever sees that he will be resurrected alone on the Day of Resurrection, this is evidence of his injustice, according to the Almighty’s saying: (Gather together the wrongdoers and their women). Seeing the Day of Resurrection and Judgment in a dream is evidence that goodness is approaching for a person and that he should be careful about his life. Crying on the path and peace is evidence of making things easier. Resurrection in one place is evidence of the spread of righteousness in that place.
