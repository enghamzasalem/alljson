If it is roasted during his sleep, this is a sign that he will obtain a lot of money, but after her fatigue, They also said that he will have a very tiring job. To reach the most accurate interpretation of your dream, search for the Egyptian Dream Interpretation website, which includes thousands of interpretations by leading interpretation scholars. Interpretation of a dream about eating chicken: If he sees that he is eating the legs, this is an indication that the dreamer will face many problems in the future. reality, which is difficult to solve. Seeing him eating her breast is very desirable in dreams, as this indicates that he will receive food and benefit, and it also indicates that he is able to pay off his debts and get rid of his troubles, and God Almighty - knows best.
