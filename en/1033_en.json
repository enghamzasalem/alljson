Sometimes the dream has an indication of goodness and in other cases it is the opposite. In this case, like other dreams that we see in a dream, the interpretation of the vision should not be taken for granted, so you must hand it all over to God. Now we will discuss the meaning of seeing a torrent in a dream through the following encyclopedia article. Interpretation of seeing a torrent in a dream It is often a vision A flood in a dream is an undesirable thing, especially if it is accompanied by the flooding of homes, the destruction of homes, or the uprooting of trees. Interpretation of a flood in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin narrated in his book (Makhtab al-Kalam fi Interpretation of Dreams) that in his interpretation of seeing a flood in a dream destroying a city or entering a house The dream indicates the spread of diseases and epidemics, or indicates the survival of many enemies, especially if the torrent is of great importance. Seeing a torrent that demolishes houses in a dream, this indicates the presence of a strong enemy lurking, who wants to harm you, and indicates that he entered the place and destroyed it. If one sees in a dream a torrent in a valley and a river, then this dream means that the dreamer wants to help a man to protect him from his enemies. If one dreams that he is trying to repel the torrent from his home and children, then this dream is an indication that he is trying to repel himself and his family from his enemies. To see tuberculosis It is going poorly without seeing rain in the dream, then this is an indication of disturbances and the consumption of forbidden money and may indicate an unjust ruler. Interpretation of torrenting by Sheikh Al-Nabulsi Sheikh Al-Nabulsi says in his book (The Smell of Animals in the Interpretation of a Dream), that if the torrent in the dream is related to the demolition of houses and the spoilage of crops And killing animals, then this dream is a dream. An indication of the enemy who is hiding. If the torrent is without destruction and is just a torrent in the dream, this indicates goodness to come or that the dreamer will receive it from his enemy. Seeing a torrent resulting from heavy rain in a dream is a sign of illness and may indicate a tiring journey. Seeing a torrent flowing in the direction of a valley or river is evidence that the dreamer is taking advantage of someone who will save him from his enemies, and that he will be saved, God willing. Sheikh Al-Nabulsi also believes that seeing a torrent in a dream indicates insincere words and lies, or indicates that the tongue of insight It is not benign, and perhaps it shows a woman with a sharp tongue and seeing a stream of blood on her. A sign of God's wrath. Everything that comes in a dream and brings with it destruction or destruction in the dream indicates misfortunes and the presence of enemies, and any water in a dream that does not bring destruction or defect is good. Imam Al-Nabulsi also mentioned in his book that swimming in a dream if the dreamer sees that He reached the land of salvation means that he was saved from the injustice he was subjected to, and vice versa if he could not reach it. The land of salvation and cannot pass. To interpret more dreams, you can use an application ",
            "text": " Seeing rain and winter in a dream is one of the common dreams that we often have, and the interpretation of torrents in a dream has many different interpretations, which differ depending on the dreamer and depending on his psychological and health condition, and social circumstances as well. Sometimes the dream has an indication of goodness and in other cases it is the opposite. In this case, like other dreams that we see in a dream, the interpretation of the vision should not be taken for granted, so you must hand it all over to God. Now we will discuss the meaning of seeing a torrent in a dream through the following encyclopedia article. Interpretation of seeing a torrent in a dream It is often a vision A flood in a dream is an undesirable thing, especially if it is accompanied by the flooding of homes, the destruction of homes, or the uprooting of trees. Interpretation of a flood in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Ibn Sirin narrated in his book (Makhtab al-Kalam fi Interpretation of Dreams) that in his interpretation of seeing a flood in a dream destroying a city or entering a house The dream indicates the spread of diseases and epidemics, or indicates the survival of many enemies, especially if the torrent is of great importance. Seeing a torrent that demolishes houses in a dream, this indicates the presence of a strong enemy lurking, who wants to harm you, and indicates that he entered the place and destroyed it. If one sees in a dream a torrent in a valley and a river, then this dream means that the dreamer wants to help a man to protect him from his enemies. If one dreams that he is trying to repel the torrent from his home and children, then this dream is an indication that he is trying to repel himself and his family from his enemies. To see tuberculosis It is going poorly without seeing rain in the dream, then this is an indication of disturbances and the consumption of forbidden money and may indicate an unjust ruler. Interpretation of torrenting by Sheikh Al-Nabulsi Sheikh Al-Nabulsi says in his book (The Smell of Animals in the Interpretation of a Dream), that if the torrent in the dream is related to the demolition of houses and the spoilage of crops And killing animals, then this dream is a dream. An indication of the enemy who is hiding. If the torrent is without destruction and is just a torrent in the dream, this indicates goodness to come or that the dreamer will receive it from his enemy. Seeing a torrent resulting from heavy rain in a dream is a sign of illness and may indicate a tiring journey. Seeing a torrent flowing in the direction of a valley or river is evidence that the dreamer is taking advantage of someone who will save him from his enemies, and that he will be saved, God willing. Sheikh Al-Nabulsi also believes that seeing a torrent in a dream indicates insincere words and lies, or indicates that the tongue of insight It is not benign, and perhaps it shows a woman with a sharp tongue and seeing a stream of blood on her. A sign of God's wrath. Everything that comes in a dream and brings with it destruction or destruction in the dream indicates misfortunes and the presence of enemies, and any water in a dream that does not bring destruction or defect is good. Imam Al-Nabulsi also mentioned in his book that swimming in a dream if the dreamer sees that He reached the land of salvation means that he was saved from the injustice he was subjected to, and vice versa if he could not reach it. The land of salvation and cannot pass. To interpret more dreams, you can use an application "
