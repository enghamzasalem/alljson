On the authority of Ibn Sirin, he looked at straw while he was awake and said: If this was in a dream! It was said: Whoever sees straw in his dream, it is wealth for the one who afflicted it, and its effect on him will appear greatly. It was said: Straw is difficult wealth because it does not arrive until after the hammer is struck. Whoever sees that he has straw, he will have good sustenance, or provisions for himself, and if he eats some of it in the dream, he will eat its price, or it will be hard, full, and disgusting. And if he puts it in a place that he does not deserve, such as boxes and cupboards, then that shows the high cost. For the livelihood and destruction of what monsters eat.
