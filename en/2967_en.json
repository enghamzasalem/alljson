That you can learn more about this vision and its interpretations for all dreamers in their different social and material situations. Interpretation of a dream about brushing teeth in a dream Brushing teeth in a dream is one of the visions that interpreters worked hard to interpret, as the materials used in cleaning, such as the brush and toothpaste, were not Available in the past, teeth were cleaned only using toothpicks. Therefore, the dream will be interpreted according to the updates developed by interpreters, taking into account that the original interpretations that represent the cornerstone of this vision were developed by great interpreters such as Ibn Sirin, and all these details you will know. In the following interpretations: If the dreamer uses toothpaste during his sleep to clean his teeth from food residue and their color becomes bright white, this is a sign of his exhaustion and the great effort that he will make to achieve his goals soon. The dream also carries another sign, which is the dreamer’s strength and his great attachment to his ambition and his ability to bear the effort, no matter how difficult it is. And heavy, but he will be happy in the end because God is (high). b) He reassured all the hardworking people in the world, and it was stated in the following Qur’an: “Thus every hardworking person in this world will certainly obtain a large share of success and excellence. Some interpreters have said that the degree of whiteness of the teeth after brushing them in a dream has many interpretations. But If the degree of whiteness is somewhat dim, this is a sign that he will wait some time to enjoy his success in this world. If the dreamer used a brush to brush his teeth in the dream and felt very tired while brushing his teeth with it, but in the end he obtained the desired result and his teeth became white and beautiful. The dream expresses the obstacles and challenges that he will face. You will find him in his future life, and there is no doubt that these difficulties will be of one of the following types: The first type: Perhaps these challenges are the lack of material resources at his disposal, and therefore he will not be able to achieve his dreams and ambitions unless he is able to provide the funds necessary to complete the path to reach his goal. The desired. The second type: The dreamer may suffer from illnesses that make him stop achieving his ambitions for a while, and after his recovery he continues to strive for success. The third type: The dreamer may face many opponents stronger than him and this will be the reason for his delay in reaching his goal because they have many possibilities that It made him reach the goal before the dreamer, but in the end God will help him and make it happen. Taste the taste of success and give him the ability to achieve his goal. If the dreamer wants to brush and clean his teeth, the dream shows three signs: First: Especially for employees who aspire to reach a position higher than their current position. "
