            "html": " What is the interpretation of seeing coal in a dream for senior scholars? When the dreamer sees burning coal in his dream, he immediately goes to reliable sources to find out what the symbol (coal in a dream) indicates, and since we are on an Egyptian site that is interested in interpreting all the symbols that appear to you in dreams, we decided to provide you with Let's show in detail what was said about this code through the following. Coal in a dream Ibn Shaheen explained that the interpretation of the dream of coal does not have a promising connotation, and he said that its most prominent connotations indicate that the devil will succeed in seducing the monarch and adorning forbidden ways for him, and thus he obtains suspicious livelihood. Actions, and these actions will be determined by the life of the seer. Perhaps he is one of the merchants who do not fear God for the quality of their goods and sell them to people at the highest prices, and who do not deserve all those prices they pay, and therefore this work will be theft of people's money. Because he will be one of the cheaters. If the dreamer is among those who work in the engineering and architecture professions, it is very likely that he is one of those who receive bribes to allow real estate owners to build wrong floors. The fields that God Almighty has forbidden completely and in detail, such as alcohol, drugs, and others. Ibn Sirin agreed with Ibn Shaheen on seeing coal in a dream and said that it represents money that God and His Messenger are not pleased with in this world and the hereafter. The first interpretation: He said that coal may mean that the dreamer will face a dangerous person, and by (dangerous) we mean here that he is very violent and his fate and position are great, and to protect the dreamer from harming any unjust person. Life, he must not be drawn to dealing with men deeply, or in the sense that he explained that he must set rules and limits for himself in his dealings with all people, and thus he will be safe from the harm of every unjust and harmful person. The second interpretation: The vision expresses the changes that will occur in the dreamer's dream and its content is that God may write him to work with the ruler or do a job that makes him close to him, because the dream contains some signs that symbolize a lot of money that the dreamer will get from the president or the sultan and the person in general does not get money except from three main players. Whether a job, inheritance, or financial assistance from family and friends. The third interpretation: Coal has many uses in life, and indeed the seer uses some necessary and useful tools at work to be at his best. In order to present the most important interpretations of the great scholars of coal, it is necessary to present what Al-Nabulsi mentioned, where he said: If the coal glows in the vision and the flame burns in it, this is a sign. From the injustice of the ruler or the president to the seer, he steals his money, especially his money. Coal has many sizes in wakefulness, and each size has its uses, and Al-Nabulsi explained that if the seer takes large pieces of coal to do something with it, he does not need that large size, but needs small pieces, this is a sign. That the important things in his life will stop for some time. His work or a project he wanted to open to enjoy its profits will stop, all of this will upset him and this will return to the viewer many positive feelings ",

When a dreamer sees burning coals in his dream, he immediately goes to reliable sources to find out what the symbol (coal in a dream) indicates, and since we are on an Egyptian website that is interested in interpreting all the symbols that appear to you in dreams, we decided to We present to you Let us show in detail what was said about this code through the following. Coal in Al-Manamoubin Ibn Shaheen stated that the interpretation of a dream about coal does not have a promising connotation, and he said that its most prominent connotations indicate that Satan will succeed in seducing the monarch and beautify forbidden paths for him, and thus obtain sustenance. suspicious. Actions, and these actions will be determined by the life of the dreamer. Perhaps he is one of the merchants who do not fear God for the quality of their goods and sell them to people at the highest prices, and who do not deserve all those prices that they pay, and therefore this action will be stealing people’s money. Because he will be one of the cheaters. If the dreamer is among those who work in the engineering and architecture professions, it is very likely that he is one of those who receive bribes to allow real estate owners to build false floors. Fields that God Almighty forbade were prohibited completely and in detail, such as alcohol, drugs, etc. Ibn Sirin agreed with Ibn Shaheen on seeing coal in a dream and said that it represents money that God and His Messenger are not pleased with in this world and the hereafter. The first interpretation: He said that coal may mean the dreamer’s encounter with a dangerous person. By (dangerous) we mean here that he is very violent and his fate and status are great, and to protect the dreamer from harming any unjust person. Life, he must not be attracted to dealing with men deeply, or in the sense that he made it clear that he must set rules and limits for himself in his dealings with all human beings, and thus be safe from harming every oppressor and harmful person. Second interpretation: The vision expresses the changes that will occur in The dreamer's dream and its content are that perhaps God will write him to work with the ruler or do a job that will make him close to him, because the dream contains some signs that symbolize a lot of money that the dreamer will get from the president or the sultan, and the person in general only gets money from three main players. Whether a job, an inheritance, or financial assistance from family and friends. The third interpretation: Coal has many uses in life, and indeed the dreamer uses some necessary and useful tools at work to be at his best. In order to present the most important interpretations of the great scholars on coal, it is necessary to present what Al-Nabulsi mentioned. Where he said: If the coal glows in the vision and the flame burns in it, then this is a sign. Whoever is wronged by the ruler or president against the seer, he will take away his money, especially his money. Coal has many sizes in the dream, and each size has its uses, and Al-Nabulsi explained that if the seer takes large pieces of coal to do something with them, he does not need that large size, but rather It needs small pieces, this is a sign. That the important things in his life will stop for a while. If his work stops or a project he wants to open to enjoy his profits, all of this will be upset and this will bring back many overwhelming feelings to the viewer "
