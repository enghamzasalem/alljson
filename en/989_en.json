The infant may be seen crying or laughing, or he may crawl in the dream, and the dreamer may see him in pain or sick. These are details that seem simple to the observer, but they are not simple at all in interpreting the vision, and through the specialized Egyptian website We will explain to you the most important things that jurists said about this dream in the following article. A child in a dream. The interpretation of a dream about a child is interpreted with a good heart. If the dreamer sees a child and carries him and hugs him, then she is a girl by nature, and does not want to harm anyone in her life, and because of her health. Nature, God, and His Messenger protect it from its enemies. If one sees his face in a dream turning into the face of a child, this is a metaphor for his healthy attitudes free of sins or suspicious actions, and therefore the dream indicates innocence. A child in a dream is considered a sign of a new birth in the dreamer’s life, as it may He starts professionally on a big project that he has never done before, and if the child is beautiful and fat, then the project will be successful and his gains will double. Some scholars said that a child who has not exceeded the age of cradle in a dream interprets that the dreamer is a different and creative person and will earn a lot of money as a result of his distinguished works. Among people. The age of the infant ranges from the age of one day to the last two or two years of breastfeeding. The jurists said that the longer it takes for the child to appear in a dream when he is young, not exceeding months or days, the dream is better than his appearance when he is one or two years old, and the older he is. The baby whenever the scene is bad and miserable. The baby in the dreamer’s vision shows that he is a person who does not like complicated things in his life, or in a clearer sense that he is a person who tends to simplicity in everything, whether at work or in his personal life, even in clothes. And his life system in general. If a child is seen in a dream and his condition is calm and does not scream, then the dreamer is one of those who solve the most difficult problems in a simple and smooth way, and this will make him stand out among the people. Al-Nabulsi said that if the dreamer sees himself as a fetus in the vision and born from his mother’s womb, then he will be born again. In his life, the scene shows the closest time to salvation and liberation from poverty and distress, and he will do so. He lives happily as his money increases and he feels the abundance and pleasure that he was deprived of before. If the dreamer sees in his dream that he is a child, knowing that he is rebellious and disobedient in reality, then his next life will be completely different from the previous one, and he will repent, and the worship that he neglected in the past will be. It is one of the most important priorities of his life, and thus he will preserve his place in Paradise, God willing. If the sick person returns to life in a dream and sees himself as a child, then his end is near and God will see him in the coming days. One contemporary jurist said that the infant is a symbol of a happy journey if he is happy in the dream, but if He cried and his screams reached the sky. The priest’s journey was ominous, and he would return from it carrying his burden. Disappointment and failure. If the dreamer sees a baby who wants milk because he is hungry, and unfortunately he remains hungry because the dreamer did not give him milk, then this is anguish and distress that the dreamer is experiencing. Sometimes a newborn baby is interpreted by weak enemies in the neighborhood ",
