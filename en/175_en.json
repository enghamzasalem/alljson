And if the dreamer continues to feed the hungry and the poor in reality and gives them a lot of money, then he dreams a lot of such a vision. When the dreamer is sick in reality and sees himself giving money and clothes to the poor, then this vision is a message from God that he will recover from his illness when he gives alms to the needy. If the dreamer dreams of a poor man asking him for money and he gives him counterfeit money, then the vision shows the dreamer's ingratitude and harsh treatment of those who are weaker than him, as he does not respect and belittles feelings. The general meaning of the dream indicates that the dreamer has bad morals and many sins in his life. If the dreamer gives a ten-pound note to the needy, and in the same dream the dreamer finds a box full of money in denominations of ten and twenty pounds, knowing that he found this money after giving the poor man the money he asked for, then the dream explains to the dreamer that whenever he pays an amount of money to charity, God will grant him many times over, and thus the door to his happiness in life lies in meeting the needs of the poor and needy. Interpretation of the dream of giving money to the poor by Ibn Sirin If the dreamer dreams of a poor man who wants money from him because he is hungry, and he gives him a lot of money, this dream may reveal the dreamer’s negligence in his religious duties, as he does not pay zakat or zakat, so the blessing in his house and throughout his life decreases. As for if the dreamer refuses to give money to a poor man in a dream, even though he had a lot of money, the scene reveals three despicable meanings, which are as follows: Or not: The dreamer’s love for the world makes him commit more sins and disobedience, and he does not remember that one day he will die and return to God and be punished for his wrong actions Religious. Second: If the dreamer is married in reality and saw this dream, then perhaps the poor man he saw in the dream is a metaphor for his family who suffer in their lives due to the dreamer's stinginess and cruelty. Third: The scene may indicate the spread of distress and poverty in the dreamer's life because he is ungrateful in his dealings with the needy, as he lives with many blessings and does not provide assistance to any poor person, and thus conflicts with God's punishment. Conditions of drought, disease, and the disappearance of blessings present in his life. Interpretation of a dream about giving money to the poor for a single woman If an unmarried woman prays to her Lord to marry and become a mother with children, and on the same day she sees that she is feeding the poor and needy, then the dream indicates that she will meet her life partner after giving part of her money to him. The poor and needy, or in a clearer sense, he is happy to solve all her problems with charity. If she sees someone from her family in a dream "
