So what is the interpretation of sea flood in a dream? We shed light on it in the following lines. Sea floods in a dream by Ibn Sirin Sea floods in a dream The interpretation of a dream in which the sea floods the state of anger and tension that a person is going through in his life and his feeling of misery as a result of some unstable problems he is going through. Some scholars of interpretation say that seeing tsunami waves in a dream expresses God's anger at the people of the place committing many sins and committing transgressions, and God knows best. If a person sees a red flood, it is an expression of the spread of a dangerous epidemic among people and a fatal disease that causes annihilation. The arrival of the flood to homes and houses represents the evil that enters those places and the intense hostility among some of its residents, and it may represent the injustice that people fall into due to the tyranny of the rulers. Most interpreters explain that a heavy flood is a sign of the spread of sedition among people, but if the water rises without harm, it is a commendable sign of public care and the public good of people. As for the flood that contains spoiled or black water, it is a sign of God's intense anger, or the abundance of injustice among people among themselves, or destruction by the spread of disease, and it may be a warning to people. Do not oppress a woman because of the one with the highest authority. Sea floods in a dream by Ibn Sirin Ibn Sirin says that the sea in a dream can carry the meaning of the head of state or the king and can refer to people who have high authority or responsibility for the dreamer himself, and from here he sees that the flood that resembles a tsunami, it is an indication of tyranny, injustice and some unpleasant events. If the dreamer sees the sea rising and raging in front of him, the dream indicates the many turbulent feelings that he carries in his heart and uncertainty as a result of the multiplicity of doctrines and seditions around him. Ibn Sirin explains that a person's feeling of extreme fear when he sees a flood is not interpreted as bad things, but in fact it is safety and reassurance, in addition to stability in life, in addition to the success that the dreamer achieves. As for salvation from the flood, Ibn Sirin says: It is an indication of the true comfort and salvation that a person obtains after going through many difficulties and many pressures.
