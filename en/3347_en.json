            "html": " Interpretation of seeing intercourse in a dream by Ibn Sirin. Visions of intercourse in a dream are among the visions that have many meanings for men and women. The interpretation of the vision varies from one person to another, male or female, and according to the circumstances that each person is going through and according to what the person saw in his dream. We will explain some interpretations of seeing intercourse in a dream for a man and a woman. Interpretation of a dream about intercourse in a dream for an unmarried woman with her lover. In Islam, dreams are a type of spiritual realization. The Qur’an refers to dreams with vision and good tidings. Many theories and observations regarding the interpretation of Islamic dreams have been proposed by many Muslim thinkers and philosophers over the past 1,500 years. Many of these observations and concepts are consistent with recent theories proposed by scientists. Modern Psychology Many of these observations and concepts are consistent with modern theories proposed by modern psychologists. Ibn Sirin, the most famous dream interpreter in the history of Islam, devised a system of dream interpretation based on the fact that both the Hadith and the Qur’an teach Muslims to respect the psychological and spiritual significance of the dream experience. God and dreams are from Satan, so if one of you sees something that he hates, let him blow on his left three times and seek refuge in God from the evil of what he saw and from Satan, then turn to his other side, for this reason. It will not harm him. Interpretation of a dream about sexual intercourse for a single woman in love. This vision, according to Ibn Sirin’s interpretation, is a detestable vision, and it shows the girl’s distance from God Almighty, and her distance from morals and the straight path. For a long time, this vision may indicate that this girl is suffering from an illness. If the duration of intercourse is long, the illness will affect her for a long time, but if the duration of intercourse is short, then the duration of her illness is fleeting, while the interpretation of a dream about sexual intercourse in a dream is for a woman alone with her lover and feeling happy and fun. This girl will be exposed to some situations, and she will lose the trust of her family, and if she feels guilty, one of her secrets will be revealed or a close friend will claim that her love will hurt her. Interpretation of a dream about intercourse without ejaculation. Ibn Sirin interpreted the dream about intercourse without ejaculation. This is evidence of Satan's inability to control him. The explanation may be the inability to achieve goals and the failure of the young man to fulfill his last desires. This is for a man, while a woman may indicate that she feels upset and that she is not responsible, but if she bathes, she will overcome all crises. Dreams are divided into three categories: Good visions: These are real or good dreams that are believed to be from God. Those who live their lives honestly are more likely to achieve true dreams. The Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: (Good vision is from God, so if one of you sees what he loves, he should not do it except for whomever he loves) Narrated by Al-Bukhari and the Messenger. He, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “There is no prophecy except good news: a good dream.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari. Disturbing dreams: It is believed that disturbing dreams are from Satan and anyone who sees a disturbing or unpleasant dream is advised to spit to his left three times when waking up from sleep, asking God ",
