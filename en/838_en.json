Therefore, we will learn about the many meanings expressed by this vision through the interpretations of the majority of jurists. Interpretation of a dream about breaking eggs by Ibn Sirin What is the interpretation of a dream about breaking eggs? Breaking eggs in a dream has many indications, including good and bad news. One of the happy signs is that the dreamer lives a comfortable life without fear and betrayal, but he only needs to be careful of all the envy and cheaters in his life so that he is not harmed by them. We find that the dream is evidence of the dreamer's attempt to correct any problems in the family. If there is someone who carries hatred in his heart towards one of the dreamer's relatives, the dreamer immediately seeks to resolve this hatred, and make the relationship between them good, that is, he will be a suitable mediator to resolve disputes in his family. As for the unlucky signs, breaking an egg means that the dreamer feels anxious and sad, but he needs to get out of this feeling and try to fix any obstacles in his life that would make him unhappy and sad in his life. The dreamer who buys eggs and they fall from them and then break indicates that he will go through many crises in his personal life and at work, but he needs to think calmly in order to understand the causes of these crises and solve them correctly, although it is better to consult some friends to help him. The vision leads to the emergence of some problems between the dreamer and his family, but he must understand that the kinship relationship pleases God (Almighty), so he must take care of his family and always ask about them so that the family is based on family love and respect. Interpretation of the dream of breaking eggs by Ibn Sirin The great Imam Ibn Sirin believes that giving broken eggs is not a good sign, especially for children, as the vision indicates that one of the dreamer's children will be exhausted, so he prays for him and does not He fears for him. The future is in the hands of God Almighty, and he will see the result of his patience and supplication with abundant goodness in the coming season. There is no doubt that every person tries to achieve his ambitions and desires that have occupied his mind since childhood, but breaking eggs results in his inability to achieve these aspirations, so he does not despair, but always tries to return to success. In achieving his goal even if it is delayed for a while, so he must be optimistic, in the future. If the dreamer is a student, this leads to his failure in his studies as a result of his negligence, so he must prove himself in the next stage and compensate for his loss to find himself in a distinguished scientific position and an important subject. The vision indicates the dreamer's inability to perform some of the tasks assigned to him by his boss at work, but it is important to try as much as possible so that he can complete all his work well without any problems.
