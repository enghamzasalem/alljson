Jinn are creatures that have powers and abilities, but they do not always follow the path of goodness, and can sometimes be mocked to cause harm. Jinn is also referred to as having power in black magic, so the interpretation of seeing a jinn depends on Jin’s condition in the dream. The dreamer deals with him, as well as the bodies of both of them. Also, banishing the jinn and reciting the Qur’an to expel them has good interpretations, but talking to the jinn or chasing the jinn and representing them in the form of humans has other meanings that are not good, which we will learn about later. Interpretation of seeing the jinnThe interpretation of seeing the jinn often has connotations. Undesirable, as the jinn was created from fire, so it often indicates problems and crises and expresses a tired soul distressed by the severity of the stumbles and painful situations it went through, but seeing the jinn running and jumping is considered an indication of the multiplicity of the dreamer’s abilities, and his unique ability to earn a living and earn money. Abundant profits from his work and practicing his trade.

Her worship is a secret that she hides from everyone, and she feels that it will appear soon and its consequences will become apparent. The interpretation of Jinn seeing an unmarried woman indicates the person who is trying to seduce her, but in reality, he does not have sincere feelings for her, but is pursuing personal goals and fears that have isolated her from the world.
