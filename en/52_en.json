The dreamer: A woman’s baldness expresses fatigue and anxiety because a woman’s hair is her crown, and a man or woman seeing a bald woman in a dream is evidence of this woman’s negligence in her household affairs or her husband’s rights to her. An unmarried woman who sees in her dream that she has lost her hair expresses, in principle, Major psychological problems, the source of which is an emotional or existential emptiness. If a girl sees as if she is looking at the woman in her dream and finds that her hair is scattered or completely fallen out, or she notices an emptiness on her head, this is an expression that she is suffering from psychological discomfort or a state of depression.

Most married women who see baldness have many worries and problems in their waking lives.
