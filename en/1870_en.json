What is the interpretation of a dream about a child in your arms? It is a good vision by all standards, as long as the child's appearance is beautiful and not dirty, and as long as his face is innocent, then seeing him in the hand of an unmarried woman can express that her date with happiness is approaching anyway. As for the married woman who wants to give birth and finds an obstacle to achieving her dream, achieving her desire is much closer than she thinks.

No, but it actually brings him more money and reputation in the world of commerce. As for the unmarried girl, it is better for her to achieve her dreams soon, and she will excel in her studies if she is still a student. When this miserable young man who has suffered a lot in his life sees this dream, this is evidence that his circumstances are different, and that they have changed significantly for the better. Ibn Sirin said that the good behind this dream is not determined by money or position only, but it is possible that the dreamer feels lonely or the absence of someone standing by him in his life, but in the near future there is a high probability of a friend or life partner to give him love and loyalty and support him and support him in his future.
