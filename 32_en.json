            "text": "If you see yourself buying a child in a dream, this indicates your future situation, and it depends on the type of child, whether it's buying a boy or buying a girl, or buying a beautiful or ugly child. The interpretation of buying a child in a dream, Ibn Sirin said in his interpretation of seeing the purchase of a child in a dream that it depends on the type of child. If a person dreams that he bought a girl child, this means that this person will experience happiness and wide living in reality. Buying a child in a dream symbolizes the existence of something in the dreamer's life that needs a lot of attention and care. Perhaps you are overwhelmed by a business project, or you are connected to a person who needs your help, or a family member is sick, and you will be the one to help him, and so on. Dreaming that you are buying children represents your willingness to help others and lend them a helping hand.  Buying a child in your dream is an indicator of your creativity and hard work, and the vision indicates that you need to release some emotions and express them. The interpretation of the dream of buying a child is evidence of the duality of your viewpoints, as you must pay attention to defining your position on certain things to be completely clear. Buying a child in a dream means that you are focusing more on one thing while ignoring other important aspects that also need attention. The interpretation of a dream about buying a child indicates that you may be in a relationship with someone who reminds you of your father, mother, or other family member. Perhaps you are struggling to find answers to some basic questions, or you are seeking the truth about something. Dreaming that you are buying a child means longevity, strength, endurance, and eternity. You don't have to deal with what happened in the past to move forward. Buying a child in a dream means that you are very upset about something someone said, but you can't express your anger properly, and the vision is a warning that it may be time to start a new beginning and leave the past behind. Whoever sees that he buys children's sets in a dream will get a lot of money. Sometimes the dream of buying a child is unfortunately a warning sign of a potentially dangerous situation. The dream, unfortunately, is a warning of low self-esteem and self-confidence. You neglect yourself a lot while trying hard to please others. If the dreamer works in the field of buying and selling and sees that he is buying a beautiful child, this indicates that he will make money through a successful business deal. Whoever dreams that he is buying a child will fall in love, and whoever buys a child will be fine. Seeing the purchase of children may reflect the dreamer's desire to adopt because he cannot have children, or because his wife does not want to get pregnant, or something similar. And whoever sees that he sold a male child, then he brings good to himself, and whoever sold a boy has no good. And if you dream of buying a very beautiful child, this indicates success and blessings in your life. If someone dreams that he sold a child in his dream, this means that this person will gain great good in reality. And if a person sells his daughter, this means that he brings himself harm and trouble. As for the person who dreams that he gave birth to a child, he grows up in the dream, this means that this person will die. The interpretation of a child in a dream according to Ibn Sirin: Ibn Sirin said in his interpretation of seeing a child in a dream that the child indicates the existence of an enemy but he is weak and cowardly. He said in his interpretation that the person who dreams that he sees himself as a child in his dream, which means that this person may lose his manhood and lust. But there is another indicator, that he was in great distress, but it was due to worry, and comfort came. As for the person who dreams that he saw a son for himself and carries him, this means that this person will be the manager of a large property. As for the person who dreams that he is with a group of children in a dream, this means that this person will be subjected to them and will be severely distressed, and he said that this interpretation is based on the fact that raising children is a great deal. Difficulty and many worries. The child shows his vision of worries, sorrows, and fatigue gently on the ignorant. Whoever took a girl or carried her while she was imprisoned or tired or indebted or poor, may God be pleased with her. Otherwise, the child is sadness and grief, especially if he was born through the mouth, this indicates death. Whoever dreams that he eats a child, he eats something forbidden. If a woman sees that she is eating a child, this indicates that she is pregnant; because the pregnant woman desires him and eats him. And whoever sees that the boy urinates so he washes himself with it, it is interpreted in two ways: paying off the debt, and wasting the money that he lost on the boy, and this may have consequences. If you dream of seeing children, it means more than just a desire to feel motherhood or fatherhood. It can indicate more things like you will make more efforts and new endeavors in your life. Also, that there is something that needs a lot of care and attention from you. The interpretation of seeing a child in a dream may vary from one person to another. If a mother dreams that her child is sick with a mild illness, this means that he is in good health, but he will do some simple things that bother her. Small children are small worries, and the dream has a psychological meaning, all children love them, but they get tired sometimes, and this is a metaphor for their anxieties. They are innocent and daily anxieties, but they are very busy when I talk about daily anxieties like studying or dressing or some daily symptoms. And the dream only means that she thinks about these worries too much and worries about them more than they deserve. The interpretation of the dream may vary from one person to another depending on whether the child is primarily the dreamer's responsibility or whether it is a responsibility entrusted to him by someone else. Most of the time, seeing a child in a dream reflects the dreamer's anxieties about having children. But it can often symbolize innocence, warmth, and new beginnings. For women who are in the process of giving birth, this dream can be a reflection of a desire that will actually come true in reality. As for men, this type of dream can be a sign of tension as a result of not wanting to experience the effects of fatherhood and bear the responsibility of the child. If you dream of a hungry child, this is a clear indication that you rely heavily on others. But if you dream of his death, it means that something will end soon. And if you forget that you have a child in a dream, this means that you are trying to hide your weakness from others. But if you see that you are going to the hospital to give birth to a child, this means that you will have to take care of matters related to your independence. And if you dream of a child crying, this means that a part of you needs care and many goals to achieve. Whoever sees that he is carrying a small child, he will come to him with little worry, then he will relax. A child generally gives a feeling of joy, security, and peace because children are the causes of joy and happiness in every home for parents... \n"

Peace be upon him.\n\nThe raging sea fish is its people who are ruthless, their youth, the elderly, or the guilty who eat each other's money and destroy each other and themselves among the common people or the rulers, rulers, and holders of positions. In general, seeing the calm waves of the sea is better in terms of goodness and interpretation than seeing the raging waves of the sea or many crawling waters or turbulent waves, and what applies to the sea is exactly what applies to the ocean because in their understanding, a very large mass of water fell in its middle and you do not see the other shore.\nWhoever sees himself entering the sea swimming, or hitting the water with cold or winter, or feeling cold, or shivering, and the wind sores in his sleep, or the sorrow of the ruler, or imprisonment, or torture, or a deadly disease, or turmoil, and if he drowns in that feeling and place, then he dies in this matter from whoever hits him. And the sea may refer to hellfire, and the ship indicates the straight path that all men walk in the Hereafter, some cross with lightning speed or slowly to approach paradise, and some fall into hell under it. As for the waves, they are according to their strength and violence or their purity and weakness in terms of good and evil, and the interpretation of the vision according to that, and similarly, seeing the sea from the lake is different from the large ocean from a small swamp. or a little water.\n\nHe was hit by mud or clay from its bottom, so whoever saw that he had entered the sea and was hit by mud or clay from the bottom, he was from the great king or from the authority of the place. And whoever crosses a sea or river to the other side passes with a whisper, or fear, or fear, and is freed from it. Some say that whoever sees the sea has struck what he hopes for, and whoever sees that he has entered the sea, then he has entered the work of the king, and he will deceive him. If he drinks it until he dies from it, then he takes money from the king and finances it with his long life and strength.\nIf he draws from it, he asks for work from the king, and takes it as much as he drew from it, if he pours it into a vessel, then he will reap from a king a lot, or God Almighty will make a situation in him. collects money, and the state is stronger, wider and longer than the sea, because it is a gift from God. And whoever bathes in the sea, his sins are forgiven and his worries about the king are removed. And whoever urinates in the sea settles in sins. And whoever sees the sea from afar sees terror, and it is said that something will approach him and he hopes. To see the calm sea is better than its turbulent waves. people and impoverish others. Its winds are its livelihood, its arrival, its accidents, its storms, its diseases, and its fish are its livelihood, its animals, its animals, its insects, its storms, its kings, its thieves, and the source of its worries and anxieties. If the sultan is in the summer and in this sea, then he may swim in knowledge and mix with scholars, or expand in money and trade according to his glorification of the sea and his strength on water.\n\nIf he drowned in his state and did not die by drowning, and he did not feel fear or distress, then he wandered in his reality, and among them is their saying: So-and-so drowned in the world and drowned in bliss. and knowledge with the sultan. But if he entered it or swam in it in winter and cold, or shivered, then a disaster has befallen him from the sultan, either imprisonment or torment, or he will be struck by a disease, dropsy, and harmful winds, or fall into a deadly death. turmoil. If he drowned in time, he was killed in his camp or his religion was corrupted in the sedition.\nDream interpretation that water or the sea:\n\nWhoever saw in a dream that the water had dried up or the sea had dried up in its place and its water had disappeared and dried up, or spread on the land of water, or prevented the rain, this is evidence of the state. disappearance, or the authority goes with the hand of the country to be lost, or disappears from the hand of whom it is attributed to, or a great loss, or the seizure of the state and damage, but if he saw the water returned or found it in another. A nearby place is evidence of the return of the state after a disturbance or conflict that did not last long.\nInterpreting the vision of receiving and drinking from its waters:\nWhoever sees that he has taken the sea water and drunk it, or even possessed it, he has gathered money from a ruler like this, or has obtained something similar from this world. And whoever entered the sea and was hit by mud or clay from its bottom, the greatest king or the authority of the place hit him. And whoever crosses a sea or river to the other side passes with a whisper, or fear, or fear, and is freed from it. Some say that whoever sees the sea has struck what he hopes for, and whoever sees that he has entered the sea, then he has entered the work of the king and he will deceive him.\nIf he drinks it until he dies from it, then he takes money from the king and finances it with his long life and his authorities, and the state is stronger, wider and longer than the sea, because it is a gift from God. . And whoever bathes in the sea, his sins are forgiven and his worries about the king are removed. And whoever urinates in the sea settles in sins. And whoever sees the sea from afar sees terror, and it is said that something will approach him and he hopes. To see the calm sea is better than its turbulent waves.\n\nDream interpretation that a person is in a place and sees the sea from afar or that it is difficult for him to reach the water:\nThis, in its interpretation, indicates that he will soon witness terror and fatigue, and it is interpreted in another way, that seeing water or the sea in a dream that you do not see, something that the dreamer hoped for is approaching him. his life.\n\nDream about the sea - YouTube \n"
